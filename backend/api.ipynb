The Chinese government did something no Western politician dares, which is delay seniors’ entitlements by raising the retirement age to 63 from 60 for male workers, 58 from 55 for white collar female workers, and 55 from 50 for blue collar female workers. The full implementation will take 15 years as, beginning in January, the retirement age will be pushed out one month every four months. The US House of Representatives and White House passed a whole host of China related bills, moving to eliminate the duty free de minimis exemption on imports under $800 and banning Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) and drones. Hong Kong stocks did not react, as these measures still need to pass in the Senate. Hong Kong posted small gains despite next week’s mid-autumn festival, which means Hong Kong will be closed on Wednesday and China’s stock market will be closed on Monday and Tuesday. The holidays also mean Southbound Stock Connect is closed until Thursday, which likely explains the profit taking in Alibaba, which fell -0.54%. Regardless of the market’s closure next week, Mainland investors bought another HKD 1.32 billion ($168 million) worth of the stock, which brings the week’s total net buy to $2.1 billion. The company also announced they bought 468,500 US ADRs yesterday which would be 4.3% of the ADR’s total volume. Over the last three weeks the company has bought 0.394% of shares outstanding. Thanks, management! Hong Kong had a decent day as all sectors were positive. The most heavily traded stocks by volume following Alibaba were Tencent, which gained +0.59% after buying 2.67 million shares today, Meituan, which gained +0.57%, Akeso, which gained +9.5%, and CNOOC, which gained +1.76%. Mainland China had a strange day that was fitting for Friday the 13th as broad indices struggled (again) on light volumes as Treasury bonds rallied (again). What made it strange was that mega cap banks and energy and materials companies such as Zijin Mining, which gained +3.38%, CYPDC, which gained +1.58% and Foxconn +2.18% held up, though CATL fell -3.09%, BYD fell -0.79%, liquor stocks Kweichow Moutai and Wuliangye Yibin fell -2.32% and -3.67%, respectively. Mid and small caps underperformed large caps. The National Team ETFs had below average volumes There is a big China economic data release coming this weekend! I caught up with my commodity trend-following friends at Mt Lucas. They are short many commodities which is likely driven by the US and global economy slowing. Everyone seems to forget that’s why the Fed is cutting, i.e. a recession is coming. Think that’s positive for US stocks or the US dollar? Me neither! Think foreign investors will stick around as their US stocks start losing money due to FX depreciation? Think the yen carry trade unwind is over? Me neither. We shall see and time will tell. Check out Mt. Lucas’ blog as lots of good, non-consensus views, in my opinion. The IMF released a piece yesterday titled “Trade Balances in China and the US Are Largely Driven by Domestic Macro Forces”. The piece takes a data driven perspective on the common US politician rhetoric that Chinese government subsidies are leading to overcapacity and flooding the world with cheap goods. The IMF is being kind when it calls such a view “incomplete” as, yes, the Chinese government does provide subsidies to “priority sectors such as software, automobiles, transportation, semiconductor and more recently green technology” though there are no signs of overcapacity. China exports lots of goods that don’t receive subsidies while even EV exports only accounted for only 1% of Chinese goods. The real issue is China’s weak domestic consumption combined with United States’ “persistent decline in US domestic savings” i.e. too much spending. It is a worthwhile read as it takes an analytical approach to an issue. The reality is the US factory utilization (77%) is higher than China’s (74.9%). The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes gained +0.75% and +0.13%, respectively, on volume that declined -3.05% from yesterday, which is 86% of the 1-year average. 339 stocks advanced while 144 stocks fell. Main Board short turnover fell -13.45% from yesterday, which is 62% of the 1-year average, as 12% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). Value and large caps outperformed growth and small caps. All sectors were positive, including healthcare, which gained +2.45%, materials, which gained +2.44%, and industrials, which gained +1.67%. The top-performing subsectors were pharmaceuticals, biotech, materials, and consumer durables. Meanwhile, food & beverage, semiconductors, and consumer services were among the worst-performing.

A former anti-corruption crusader, he was jailed in connection with a now-scrapped alcohol sales policy. Mr Kejriwal\\'s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) introduced the policy in November 2021, saying it would curb black market sales, increase revenues and ensure even distribution of liquor licences. It was withdrawn a few months later after Delhi’s Lieutenant-Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena accused AAP of exploiting rules to benefit private liquor barons. Mr Kejriwal and AAP deny the charges. They said the allegations were \"politically motivated\". On Friday, a Supreme Court bench of Justice Surya Kant and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan granted Mr Kejriwal bail and directed him to refrain from making any public comments. The court also directed Mr Kejriwal to refrain from attending office or signing any official files. The judges said they had decided to grant him bail since charges had been framed and the trial was unlikely to be completed sometime soon, legal website Live Law reported. Mr Kejriwal was released on interim bail for three weeks in May to campaign for the parliamentary elections on the condition that he would abstain from his official duties as chief minister. Mr Kejriwal was the third AAP leader arrested in the case. His former deputy, Manish Sisodia, was granted bail in August after 17 months in jail. Another AAP leader, Sanjay Singh, was released on bail in April. Critics of India’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have often alleged that it has used investigating agencies to unjustly target opposition leaders, a charge it denies. Mr Kejriwal’s arrest in March just weeks before key parliamentary elections had drawn comments from the US and Germany. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller had said Washington was closely monitoring his arrest and actions taken against opposition parties in India – drawing \"strong objection\" from Delhi. A mechanical engineer, Mr Kejriwal was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay prize – often called Asia’s Nobel – in 2006 for popularising the Right to Information law that allows citizens to access information from the government. But he gained national prominence following massive anti-corruption protests in 2011 against the then governing Congress party. Inspired by the campaign\\'s success, he founded the AAP, pledging to eradicate corruption and to take on the Congress and the BJP. AAP made its poll debut in 2013 Delhi Assembly elections and has governed the capital city since, focussing on welfare measures such as affordable electricity and water for residents. His party has since contested multiple parliamentary and assembly elections across the country with limited success. Besides Delhi, the party is in power in Punjab. It is also now a part of INDIA, a loose bloc of opposition parties led by the Congress. As elections are held after a 10-year gap, people in Kashmir say they have waited long to be heard. The famous Tirupati temple laddus are prized by devotees who consider them god’s blessing. They are among 46 victims in the northern Bihar state during a festival for children\\'s wellbeing. No-one was injured in the incident, which occurred during heavy rains in Bihar state. A court has allowed jailed lawmaker Engineer Rashid to return to Kashmir to campaign in regional polls.'}, {'title': \"I'm 43 and my honeymoon was the only time I traveled without my parents.

At 43, she finally took the decision to travel solo.', 'content': 'This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Minreet Kaur. It has been edited for length and clarity. Whizzing around in a tuk-tuk in the Sri Lankan city of Kandy, I felt exhilarated as the rickety vehicle weaved in and out of the traffic. It was just as thrilling as the ride I\\'d taken along bumpy roads with a busload of locals between the island\\'s capital and a gorgeous beach. The sense of freedom and independence was overwhelming. At 43, I finally found the courage to travel alone. Until July this year, I\\'d only been away with family members, usually my mom. The one time she didn\\'t join me was the honeymoon I spent with my former husband in 2008. The relationship lasted a year, and I moved back in with my parents. I\\'ve been single since then. Before and after my marriage, I spent every break with the people who raised me. I\\'m from a traditional Sikh family, and traveling as a unit is often customary. I never went on vacation with girlfriends, for example. But I didn\\'t feel like I was missing out. I always had fun with my close relatives. Over the years, we have visited places in the UK, such as North Wales, and flown to Canada and India to stay with our extended family. My dad, now 76, joined us. Around his mid-50s, he decided he didn\\'t like traveling much and generally preferred to stay at home. Luckily for me, my mom was more adventurous. She\\'s easygoing and a great travel companion. We\\'ve been to cities across Europe, such as Valencia, and further afield, to Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi. Mom was up for anything. Our most hilarious vacation was in Cyprus. One day, we went on a coach trip and got off at the wrong stop, ending up in a resort town that was party central. There were all these young people on the beach, half of them naked. But Mom went ahead and enjoyed herself, thinking it was funny. Unfortunately, we couldn\\'t travel during COVID. I missed it a lot because it broadens your mind. It made me feel a bit trapped in the house. Then, my mom contracted blood cancer at 72. I\\'m a freelance writer, but I am now her primary carer. I coordinate her medical treatments and handle all the paperwork. In many Asian families, it often falls on daughters to take responsibility for their parents as they get older. It\\'s a respect thing. I\\'m happy to help. but it\\'s difficult when you\\'re trying to juggle it with work. Mom noticed how hard it was. Despite her health issues, she recognized that I needed to spread my wings. \"You should travel again, even on your own,\" she said. \"I\\'ll be fine.\" I realized I was the main person holding myself back. It was a combination of guilt about leaving my parents and fear of stepping out of my comfort zone. But I knew I was getting older and should embrace new opportunities. So, two months ago, I decided to take life by the horns and visit Sri Lanka. I met some great people. We went on a safari, spotted elephants, and toured the hill country. I rode a motorbike, visited a religious site, and saw beautiful waterfalls. I felt daring but perfectly safe. It was good to be in my own company. I gained more confidence as the days went on. I was never anxious or scared because I wasn\\'t with my family. Still, I was in touch with my parents daily, so they didn\\'t worry about me. My uncles and a few friends who lived nearby checked in on my mom and her procedures. Mom and Dad were perfectly OK when I returned. Mom was particularly pleased to hear about my adventures. The whole experience has left me wanting more. I\\'ve drawn up a bucket list of places I want to visit, including Japan, for next year\\'s cherry blossom season. Meanwhile, I\\'m turning 44 in November and have decided to celebrate with a trip to Bali. Solo travel has opened up a fascinating new chapter in my life.

Who: India vs Pakistan What: Men’s Asian Champions Trophy round-robin match When: Saturday, September 14, 3:45pm (07:45 GMT) Where: Moqi Hockey Training Base, Hulunbuir, China How: Follow Al Jazeera’s live text coverage South Asian sports fans can expect a mouthwatering contest on Saturday between India and Pakistan. The contest, though, will play out on the blue artificial pitch of a hockey ground and not the grassy green cricket venues that are synonymous with India-Pakistan encounters. Three months after their match at the International Cricket Council (ICC) Men’s T20 World Cup in New York, the neighbours will renew their rivalry in Hulunbuir – a northeastern Chinese city in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region – during the round-robin stage of the Asian Hockey Federation (AHF) Men’s Asian Champions Trophy. Here’s everything you need to know about the sport, the tournament and the upcoming match: You bet. Simply put, the two South Asian sides ruled the world of hockey until the early 1990s. Up until the 1947 partition, which led to the creation of Pakistan, the then-Indian team included players from both sides of the border that now divides them and won gold at the 1928, 1932 and 1936 Olympic Games. Between them, India and Pakistan share 11 Olympic gold medals, five world titles, three FIH Champions Trophy titles and dozens of hockey legends. It’s worth mentioning that hockey – not cricket – is the national sport of both India and Pakistan. Olympic gold medals World Cups Champions Trophy Sultan Azlan Shah Cup Asia Cup Asian Champions Trophy Asian Games gold medals South Asian Games gold medals The 1947 partition led to the creation of two separate states, India and Pakistan. It also gave birth to a decades-long mostly political rivalry that spilled over into sport. The 1950s and 1960s saw India and Pakistan win five Olympic gold medals between them. They clashed in three finals, of which India won two. The teams have only met once in the World Cup final – in 1975, when India won. Regardless of the tournament and the occasion, their meetings always garner peak interest and lead to sold-out games and widespread media coverage. Matches played: 180 Won by India: 66 Won by Pakistan: 82 Drawn: 32 Goals scored by India: 377 Goals scored by Pakistan: 402 India have been producing better results of the two South Asian neighbours in the past few years. Most recently, India won the bronze medal at the Paris Olympics 2024 and are the reigning champions of the Asian Games, Asian Champions Trophy and Commonwealth Games. The men in blue are undefeated in their four games at the current tournament. Last five results: Of late, Pakistan’s form and returns on the hockey pitch have been mixed. The Greenshirts have won two and drawn two of their four round-robin stage matches at the ongoing tournament. Shockingly, Pakistan have failed to qualify for the last three Olympic Games and two of the last three World Cups. Last five results: Simply known as hockey, the 11-a-side sport is played on a synthetic pitch – also known as Astroturf – between two teams. All 11 players move a hockey ball with a hockey stick with the aim of slotting it into the back of the opposition’s goal. The team scoring more goals wins. Hockey sticks are made from a mixture of fibreglass, carbon and aramid and include a long handle that leads to a curved head that is used for manoeuvring the ball on the field and hitting it into the goal. The global governing body of the sport is the International Hockey Federation (FIH). A goal can only be scored from inside the striking circle and can come from direct play, penalty corners or penalty strokes. A hockey match is played over 60 minutes, divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each. Half-time is taken between the second and third quarters and lasts 15 minutes. Two-minute breaks are taken after the first and third quarters. Stoppages in play due to injuries or the ball being out of play lead to the halting of the clock, which usually makes the game last longer than the stipulated 60 minutes. Up until 2019, the game was played across two halves of 35 minutes each with a five-minute break in between. A continental hockey tournament that began in 2011, this contest is played amongst the six best teams in the region. All teams face each other in a round-robin format and the top four qualify for the semifinals.

Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (NOA) using AI narration. Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris may not agree on much, but on one issue they’re in complete accord: They want to block the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by the Japanese firm Nippon Steel. Nippon and U.S. Steel agreed to the $14.9 billion deal last December. But in March, President Biden said it was “vital” for U.S. Steel to remain “an American steel company.” Last month, Trump said, “I will stop Japan from buying U.S. Steel.” And last week, Harris said that the company “should remain American-owned and American-operated.” This all bodes very badly for the deal. Federal law gives presidents the legal authority to stop a foreign acquisition on national-security grounds, as long as an interagency group called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States recommends that the deal be killed, and the committee has flagged a series of supposed such national-security concerns in a letter to Nippon Steel. On Wednesday, a top Nippon executive flew to Washington, D.C., to meet with the committee’s members in an attempt to save the deal. Given that the White House has come out emphatically against the acquisition, however, this late lobbying effort seems unlikely to persuade the American officials to recommend that the deal go through. That is not because national security would actually be imperiled by Nippon’s purchase of U.S. Steel. Although founded more than a century ago, and once the largest producer of steel in the world, the Pittsburgh-based company is no longer even the biggest steelmaker in America. Instead, political considerations have made the deal a nonstarter. The proposed foreign acquisition of this iconic national brand is unpopular generally in Pennsylvania (a crucial swing state in a closely contested election year), and especially so with the United Steelworkers union (a crucial in-state labor constituency for Harris, whom the union endorsed in July). So as cover for meeting their political ends, officials in Washington are using an absurdly broad definition of what constitutes a threat to national security. That’s a bad, disingenuous way to make policy. It also, paradoxically, may end up leaving American steelworkers worse off. Purely on the merits, blocking the deal makes little sense. After U.S. Steel put itself up for auction last year, Nippon’s bid proved substantially higher than the next highest, from the American steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs (several other domestic and foreign buyers were said to be in the running). And in contrast to U.S. Steel’s own record of doing little to upgrade its older plants and facilities, Nippon has promised to spend billions to modernize the American firm’s aging blast-furnace plants in Pennsylvania and at Gary, Indiana. Unfortunately for Nippon, the most important player in the whole affair is not U.S. Steel, but United Steelworkers, which represents about half of the company’s workers. And although some rank-and-file workers would like the deal to go through, the union’s president, David McCall, has been intent on stopping the Nippon deal pretty much from the moment it was announced. Nippon has gone to considerable lengths to address McCall’s concerns, promising that it will honor all of U.S. Steel’s contractual commitments to its workers, and committing to a $2.7 billion investment in those blast-furnace plants. But McCall has, if anything, become more intransigent, with the union declaring, “We can’t trust in what USS and Nippon are telling us.” Even so, the Committee on Foreign Investment—created by Gerald Ford in 1975 to provide analysis of inward investment, and later given formal authority by Congress—is supposed to evaluate deals not with an eye toward politics, but purely according to their implications for national security. Under the law, labor opposition should have no impact on the deal’s outcome. Nor, for that matter, should Pennsylvania’s importance in the Electoral College. The committee has tried to manufacture a national-security rationale for killing the deal. But its argument that a Nippon acquisition would make America less safe is implausible at best. The U.S. defense industry’s demand for steel is small; only about 3 percent of domestic production is purchased by the Pentagon. As for Nippon’s foreign ownership, Japan is no hostile power but one of America’s closest and most loyal allies. Rolling metal is not making microchips, and U.S. Steel is no technological pioneer—if anything, it’s become something of an industry also-ran. The deal will not move American steel production abroad; more likely, it would lead to more manufacturing at home. In a letter that the committee sent to Nippon and U.S. Steel, officials expressed concern that Nippon might try to import steel from India, where it has plants.

Basic income — recurring, unconditional payments — can describe two different programs: universal basic income (UBI) or guaranteed basic income (GBI). UBI does not distinguish between recipients, while GBI targets specific communities. Both kinds of programs provide funds for people to spend where they need it most, as opposed to government assistance programs like SNAP or Medicaid that target specific spending categories, like food and healthcare. Though experts continue to debate the pros and cons of universal basic income, the Stanford Basic Income Lab reports that 12 countries besides the US have active basic income initiatives. Here are countries with active basic income programs, listed in alphabetical order. All monetary values have been converted into US dollars. In Maricá, Brazil, the Citizens\\' Basic Income program provides universal basic income to over 93,000 of the city\\'s 197,000 residents. The program was launched in 2019 to revamp the city\\'s basic income endeavor and increase participation. All recipients are residents of Maricá and in Brazil\\'s federal registry for social programs, which identifies low-income households. In 2013, the city formed the Banco Mumbuca — a community bank that issues a digital currency called mumbuca. The currency can only be used via card or app in the city and is not convertible to cash. Maricá has offered some residents a form of basic income in monthly mumbuca payments since then. In 2019, the program began paying $57 in mumbuca monthly to individuals — previously, payments were made to households. The Citizens\\' Basic Income program was expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic. From April 2020 to December 2021, the payment increased to $127. In May 2022, it decreased to $79. At the end of 2023, the program increased payments to $84 and expanded to over 93,000 residents. It\\'s been about 50 years since Canada\\'s UBI experiment was launched in Manitoba. And now, a GBI program is active in the country. In British Columbia, the government runs the Agreements with Young Adults guaranteed basic income program, which targets young people previously in foster care or legally removed from their families. The program began in 2022 and focuses on people between the ages of 19 and 26 who have aged out of youth care. It is structured in six-month agreements, during which recipients receive up to $1,250 monthly, depending on individual needs. The program aims to cover living expenses like housing, food, and transportation to help young people finish school, complete a rehabilitation program, or attend other life skills training. Recipients can be a part of the program for a total of 48 months. In Macau, the government runs a universal basic income program for residents called the Wealth Partaking Scheme. Since 2008, the government of Macau has provided unconditional basic income to its permanent and non-permanent residents. Individuals must have a Macau identity card to receive the payments. Residents receive the lump sum payment by check, whereas specific residents, such as retired civil servants, can receive bank transfers. The annual payment is not fixed and is subject to changing regulations each year. Each year, the Macau government announces its stipulations for payments. In 2024, permanent residents received $1,250, while non-permanent residents received $750. Mein Grundeinkommen, which translates to \"my basic income,\" is a German nonprofit that provides basic income via a raffle. Mein Grundeinkommen is based in Berlin and began the raffle in 2014. Since then, the program has had 1,500 winners. Anyone can participate in the Mein Grundeinkommen raffle, regardless of age, gender, nationality, or income. Mein Grundeinkommen runs two programs. The \"utopian basic income\" program provides $1,100 monthly for one year. Meanwhile, the \"realistic basic income\" program provides up to $1,320 monthly for three years, depending on the participant\\'s income. Alongside the raffle, the Berlin-based nonprofit ran a basic income pilot from 2021 to 2024 called Pilotprojekt Grundeinkommen. In the pilot, 122 people received about $1,320 monthly for three years. The last payment was made in May 2024. Researchers are analyzing the data, and results are expected in January 2025. In Tamil Nadu, a state in Southeast India, the government is piloting a guaranteed basic income program for women called the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai, which roughly translates to \"women\\'s rights grant.\" The program provides basic income for women in the region who are responsible for supporting themselves or their families. Eligibility requirements target women with limited access to land and electricity. Participants must be women aged 21 or older with an annual family income of roughly $3,000 or less. Participants receive about $12 monthly.

The age of electric mobility is upon us. In times when new launches are happening every month, not every release gathers the same amount of attention and anticipation among global audiences. One manufacturer that definitely did create some serious hype was India’s Ola Electric. The company that started as a cab aggregator quickly went hard into the mobility space with a series of super-affordable, high-tech electric scooters and a giga-scale \"Futurefactory\" capable of producing a bike every two seconds. These practical little things were mainly relevant to the local market – but the world definitely took notice when Ola launched the first of its proposed four full-sized electric bikes, the Roadster, this past month. Lauded globally for offering impressive performance metrics at a bargain price – 120-mph (200-km/h) top speeds at less than US$3,000 for the top model – hopes were high thanks to Ola\\'s neat-looking renders of the motorcycle. But Indian journos have now seen these machines in the flesh, and the contrast between marketing and reality looks pretty stark. The motorcycle manufacturer recently showcased its entire Roadster lineup, which comprises the entry-level X variant, the standard Roadster, and the top-of-the-line Pro trim. While all of these models are available for preorder, and Ola\\'s website shows delivery dates for each of them, the Roadster Pro’s deliveries aren\\'t slated to begin until September 2026, more than two years after its launch – and Indian dealers are only committing to base variant deliveries at the moment. Much of the hype surrounding the Ola Roadster was centered on its features-to-price ratio. While the base variant is priced at 74,999 Indian rupees (which translates to an unbelievable US$890), it\\'s now clear it\\'s not the fancy, feature-laden offering most people thought it would be. The Roadster X gets a drum brake at the rear, and there is no ABS on offer. It gets an LCD console (the same thing that comes on the S1 scooter) rather than the much-advertised full-color TFT panel, which seems to be saved for the more expensive variants. It gets what the brand terms \"standard forks\" at the front and twin shock absorbers at the back – a setup that simply seems inadequate to take on the tough riding conditions that India is known for. Also missing are an aluminum swingarm (there\\'s a rectangular box-section swingarm instead) and diamond-cut alloys – both of which garnered a lot of attention when the initial feature list came out. While it\\'s obvious that the company has cut down on its hardware to save costs, the harsh truth is that the Roadster X is not that much different from many other plain-Jane commuters that make up the Indian two-wheeler eco-system. While the base model\\'s claimed top speed of 77 mph (124 km/h) and a range of 125 miles (200 km) might have fascinated you when the bike was announced, both of these numbers only apply to the more expensive 4.5-kWh battery pack variant of the Roadster X, which is priced at 99,999 rupees (US$1,190). The US$890 standard trim comes with a piddling 2.5-kWh battery pack that\\'s only good for a 65-mph (105-km/h) top speed and a 72-mile (117-km) claimed range. Everyone knows real-world numbers will be lower again. So the flashy-looking high-performance bike is years away, and the launch bike is both magnificently awkward, ugly and poorly specified. If that was all, and this was just another disappointing case of marketing meets reality, it might be more or less business as usual. But it\\'s not all – because Ola\\'s marketing team has also managed to score a spectacular own-goal with the Roadster\\'s press photos. We’ve been referencing how enchanted global audiences were by Ola’s promises when it first revealed the Roadster. A huge credit for that has to go to the product teasers that the brand created – or stole from an American competitor, as it now appears. It didn\\'t take long for the Internet to notice some distinct similarities between Ola\\'s press photos and earlier shots published by California\\'s Zero Motorcycles – and when placed side by side, it\\'s absolutely undeniable. Social media posts from a number of Indian automotive enthusiasts rapidly went viral, sparking debates not just about Ola\\'s morals and business ethics, but about exactly how stupid a marketing team would have to be to nakedly steal copyright images from a competitor, paste their own motorcycle renders in, and then publish them on the internet. It beggars belief that anyone would think they could get away with this kind of thing in 2024. “How sad,\" writes Abrar Bin Ayub, Product Manager at Hero Tech Center Germany for Vida World. \"Folks at Ola Electric completely ripped off the work of Zero Motorcycles Inc.

Colombo, Sri Lanka – It was an unlikely invitation from the Indian government. In early February, Anura Kumara Dissanayake visited New Delhi to meet the South Asian giant’s foreign minister, national security adviser and senior diplomats. The 55-year-old Sri Lankan politician is not in government. National People’s Power, the political alliance he leads, isn’t even the principal opposition. It has only three seats in the country’s 225-member parliament, where it’s the fourth-largest force. And his party has often been seen as close to China, India’s principal geopolitical rival. But for months now, Dissanayake has enjoyed a different kind of authority within Sri Lankan politics, which has in turn earned him recognition as a rising political force even from regional superpower India. He is a surprise top contender for the country’s presidency, when the Indian Ocean island votes on September 21. Some opinion polls even suggest he could be the frontrunner, among a crowd of 38 candidates. It’s a lineup littered with familiar faces from the country’s most prominent political families: Namal Rajapaksa, the eldest son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa; Sajith Premadasa, the son of another former president, R Premadasa; and incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinge, a nephew of the country’s first executive President JR Jayewardene. Dissanayake stands out among that set: He is the leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), a party that has never previously been close to national power and that twice led Marxist insurrections against the very state Dissanayake now wants to rule. The turning point for the party and the NPP, the coalition it leads, came in 2022, when the country’s economy collapsed, leading to widespread shortages of essential goods and skyrocketing inflation. A mass protest movement – known as the Aragalaya [Sinhalese for “struggle”] – against the ruling government forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s resignation after his brother Mahinda, the prime minister, also had to quit. The brothers were forced to flee an angry nation. Though no political party officially claimed the leadership of the Aragalaya movement, the JVP played an active role, holding daily protests, erecting tents in Colombo’s picturesque Galle Face and organising general strikes. The power vacuum created by the resignation of the Rajapaksa brothers paved the way for Dissanayake and the JVP to amplify calls for broader change, attracting disillusioned citizens to their advocacy for social justice and against corruption. From the margins, the party grew into a credible, major political force. And Dissanayake’s personal appeal has soared with his party’s. “I see he is honest in attempting to change the system,” writer and political analyst Gamini Viyangoda told Al Jazeera. Viyangoda is a co-convenor of the Purawesi Balaya civil society movement that campaigns for democratic reform in Sri Lanka. “When he says he’d close the doors to corruption, I believe he means it. Whether he’d manage to do it or not is another matter, but I haven’t seen this genuineness in any other political leader,” Viyangoda said. Born in a rural middle-class family in the village of Thambuttegama, 177km (110 miles) from the capital Colombo, in Sri Lanka’s Anuradhapura district, Dissanayake graduated with a science degree from the University of Kelaniya. He had been involved with the JVP since his school days and first became a member of parliament in 2000. Dissanayake was appointed the JVP leader in 2014 and has since tried to reimagine the party’s image as distinct from its violent past. In 1971 and then in the late 1980s, the party had led failed Marxist-inspired insurrections. The armed uprising launched by the JVP in 1988-89, calling for the overthrow of what they saw as the imperialist and capitalist regime of Presidents JR Jayawardene and R Premadasa, became one of the bloodiest periods in Sri Lankan history. Widespread killings and political assassinations, unofficial curfews, sabotage and strikes called by the JVP were the order of the day. The JVP’s victims – the Marxists are believed to have killed thousands of people – included intellectuals, artists and trade unionists in addition to political opponents. The state retaliated by brutally crushing the rebellion with mass arrests, torture, abductions and mass murder. At least 60,000 people were killed in the government crackdown, including most senior JVP leaders, among them its founder Rohana Wijeweera. Dissanayake was appointed to the JVP politburo after the failed insurrection when the party abandoned violence and turned to electoral democracy. Speaking with the BBC in May 2014, soon after he became the leader of the JVP, Dissanayake apologised for the party’s past crimes. It was the first and the last time ever that.'}, {'title': 'Microsoft’s Hypocrisy on AI', 'link': 'https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/09/microsoft-ai-oil-contracts/679804/', 'date': '2024-09-13', 'short_description': 'Can artificial intelligence really enrich fossil-fuel companies and fight climate change at the same time? The tech giant says yes.', 'content': 'Can artificial intelligence really enrich fossil-fuel companies and fight climate change at the same time? The tech giant says yes. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (NOA) using AI narration. Microsoft executives have been thinking lately about the end of the world. In a white paper published late last year, Brad Smith, the company’s vice chair and president, and Melanie Nakagawa, its chief sustainability officer, described a “planetary crisis” that AI could help solve. Imagine an AI-assisted tool that helps reduce food waste, to name one example from the document, or some future technology that could “expedite decarbonization” by using AI to invent new designs for green tech. But as Microsoft attempts to buoy its reputation as an AI leader in climate innovation, the company is also selling its AI to fossil-fuel companies. Hundreds of pages of internal documents I’ve obtained, plus interviews I’ve conducted over the past year with 15 current and former employees and executives, show that the tech giant has sought to market the technology to companies such as ExxonMobil and Chevron as a powerful tool for finding and developing new oil and gas reserves and maximizing their production—all while publicly committing to dramatically reduce emissions. Although tech companies have long done business with the fossil-fuel industry, Microsoft’s case is notable. It demonstrates how the AI boom contributes to one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today—despite the fact that the technology is often lauded for its supposed potential to improve our world, as when Sam Altman testified to Congress that it could address issues such as “climate change and curing cancer.” These deals also show how Microsoft can use the vagaries of AI to talk out of both sides of its mouth, courting the fossil-fuel industry while asserting its environmental bona fides. (Many of the documents I viewed have been submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company has omitted from public disclosures “the serious climate and environmental harms caused by the technology it provides to the fossil fuel industry,” arguing that the information is of material and financial importance to investors. A Microsoft spokesperson said the company was unaware of the filing and had not been contacted by the SEC.) For years, Microsoft routinely promoted its work with companies such as Schlumberger, Chevron, Halliburton, ExxonMobil, Baker Hughes, and Shell. Around 2020, the same year Microsoft made ambitious climate commitments that included a goal to reach carbon negativity by 2030, the tech firm grew quieter about such partnerships and focused on messaging about the transition to net zero. Behind the scenes, Microsoft has continued to seek business from the fossil-fuel industry; documents related to its overall pitch strategy show that it has sought energy-industry business in part by marketing the abilities to optimize and automate drilling and to maximize oil and gas production. Over the past year, it has leaned into the generative-AI rush in an effort to clinch more deals—each of which can be worth more than hundreds of millions of dollars. Microsoft employees have noted that the oil and gas industries could represent a market opportunity of $35 billion to $75 billion annually, according to documents I viewed. Based on the documents, executives see these generative-AI tools—the buzziest new technology since the iPhone, and one that Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in—as a kind of secret weapon for client outreach. During an internal conference call with more than 200 employees last September, a Microsoft energy exec named Bilal Khursheed noted that, since the company’s generative-AI investments, the energy industry was turning to Microsoft for guidance on AI in a way that had perhaps “never happened before.” “We need to maximize this opportunity. We need to lay out the pathway to adopting generative AI,” he said, according to a transcript of the meeting I viewed. One such pathway? Using generative algorithms to model oil and gas reservoirs and maximize their extraction, Hema Prapoo, Microsoft’s global lead of oil and gas business, said later in the meeting. Several documents also emphasize Microsoft’s unique relationship with OpenAI as an additional selling point for energy clients, suggesting that GPT could drive productivity separate from fossil-fuel extraction. (OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.) From a business perspective, of course, Microsoft’s pursuit of massive deals with fossil-fuel companies makes sense. And such partnerships do not necessarily mean that the company is contradicting its climate commitments. Microsoft executives have made the case that AI can also help fossil-fuel companies improve their environmental footprint. Indeed, both Microsoft and its energy customers defend their partnerships by arguing that their goals work in harmony, .'}, {'title': 'Infinix could unveil an ultra-thin smartphone measuring under 6mm', 'link': 'https://www.phonearena.com/news/infinix-could-unveil-ultra-thin-smartphone-measuring-under-6mm_id162560', 'date': '2024-09-13', 'short_description': 'Not too long ago, Infinix, the Chinese smartphone maker, unveiled its Hot 50 5G, boasting a sleek 7.8 mm profile.

Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has unfrozen the bank accounts of the social media platform X and the satellite internet company Starlink after ordering the transfer of more than $3m owed in fines. In a statement on Friday, the country’s highest court said the Brazilian government retrieved 7.2 million Brazilian reais ($1.3m) from an X bank account and almost 11 million Brazilian reais ($1.9m) from a Starlink account to settle the fines. “After the payment of the full amount that was owed, Justice [de Moraes] considered there was no need to keep the bank accounts frozen and ordered the immediate unfreezing of bank accounts/financial assets,” the statement says. De Moraes previously made the controversial decision to ban X in Brazil after its owner, right-wing billionaire Elon Musk, refused to comply with court orders to remove accounts accused of spreading misinformation. The social media platform also failed to meet a deadline to name a legal representative in Brazil, as required by law. Musk owns both X and Starlink and initially, after the court’s ban on X, Starlink representatives reportedly indicated their internet service would not comply with the restriction. Still, the decision to penalise both X and Starlink has been questioned by legal analysts since they function as separate companies. In response to the court’s decision to shutter X, Musk called de Moraes an “evil dictator”. The South African billionaire has shown a penchant for promoting far-right conspiracy theories and false claims about election fraud. Musk also expressed sympathy for supporters of Brazil’s former right-wing leader, Jair Bolsonaro, who spread unsubstantiated claims about the country’s October 2022 election, which he lost. Bolsonaro’s supporters ultimately called for a military coup to reverse his loss and stormed the country’s legislature on January 8, 2023. Bolsonaro has since been barred from holding office until 2030, and like Musk, he has clashed with Justice de Moraes over inquiries into his actions. While Musk has denounced efforts by liberal governments to restrict the spread of false claims on X, he has expressed few qualms in the past about removing content at the request of right-wing governments seeking to crack down on dissent or silence critical voices. In 2023, X, previously known as Twitter, agreed to a request from the government of India’s Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi to block access to a BBC documentary exploring his role in an anti-Muslim pogrom in 2002. “The rules in India for what can appear on social media are quite strict, and we can’t go beyond the laws of the country,” Musk said at the time. “If we have a choice of either our people go to prison or we comply with the laws, we will comply with the laws.”.'}, {'title': \"As she flies to India this weekend, Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan's mission is clear\", 'link': 'https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-14/jacinta-allan-india-visit-international-student-university-caps/104348516', 'date': '2024-09-13', 'short_description': \"Jacinta Allan's first trip abroad as premier couldn't come at a more critical time.

Mr Mooney believes the premier\\'s journey to the Indian capital will be critical in helping her understand how the complex nation\\'s bureaucracy and government work. \"India is so diverse, it\\'s like 28 different countries and it\\'s like doing business with 28 different countries,\" Mr Mooney said, referring to the varying philosophy of each Indian state. \"Delhi is more the political sphere and her going there is massive, but I think she should now start going once a year and start visiting different states each time, to look at how she can do business in other parts of the country that are less bureaucratic.\" There is no doubt an element of clever politics to this trip. Victoria is home to the largest Indian diaspora in Australia — roughly 40 per cent of Indian-born Australians live in the state. More than 260,000 Indian-born Australians call Melbourne home. According to national census data, the population of Indian Australians has grown by more than 100 per cent between 2011 and 2021 – and the community growth hasn\\'t gone unnoticed among political strategists, who say Indian Australians are now a substantial voting bloc. The Liberal Party has often discussed ways in which it can start winning over Indian-Australian voters in Melbourne\\'s outer suburbs.

We decided to tally them up, so here are the major fines Google has paid over the last ten years and the reasons behind them. Ten years seems a reasonable window to consider, but it isn’t completely arbitrary. Google hadn’t been caught out so significantly before that, and when it was, the reparations were relatively small, at least compared to the ones you’ll see below. QUICK ANSWER Google has been asked to pay fines totaling around $11.4 billion dollars in the last ten years. Adjusting for inflation, the real-terms value of these penalties comes to over $14 billion dollars. JUMP TO KEY SECTIONS Below are all of Google’s major fines over the last ten years, listed in chronological order. They were imposed in various currencies, but we’ve converted them to the equivalent amount in US dollars at the time to total them. We also wanted to know how much each of those fines would be worth in today’s money, so we adjusted them for inflation based on the year they were handed down using an inflation calculator. As you can see, Google’s infractions have cost the company a hefty amount over the years. The fines imposed total around $11.4 billion and will feel like more to the company’s balance sheet today. Since the biggest penalties were doled out several years ago, those amounts would be worth much more by now with a bit of basic investing. The inflation-adjusted total comes to over $14 billion. If that looks bad, these fines aren’t even all that Google has been asked to fork out. The figures don’t include settlements of lawsuits, such as the $400 million it was hit for in a 2022 privacy case and another $700 million last year relating to the Play Store and sideloading. We’ve only listed the major fines that Google has received, and just those in the last ten years. Between small fines for the company and its subsidiaries since its foundation in 1998, it’s very difficult to know how many times it has been penalized in total. Are you wondering what got Google in hot water with the authorities? Here’s a very brief overview of the reasons each fine was imposed. 2017 — European Commission Google was fined in Europe for abusing its dominance in search engine markets to favor its own comparison-shopping service over competitors. If the €2.42 billion amount sounds oddly similar to the one you’ve seen in the headlines this week, it’s no coincidence. It’s the same case that Google has been attempting to overturn ever since. 2018 — European Commission The biggest punishment ever levied on Google — one of the largest in history — was this €4.34 billion fine for antitrust violations regarding Android. Google was found guilty of requiring manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and Chrome as a condition for accessing the Google Play Store, effectively limiting competition from other browsers and search engines. 2019 — European Commission The European Commission wasn’t done with Google, this time whacking the tech giant with a €1.49 billion punishment for abusing its dominance in the online advertising market. Google had imposed restrictive clauses in contracts with third-party websites, preventing them from displaying ads from Google’s competitors. 2019 — US Federal Trade Commission The big Google fine in the US was more specifically for its subsidiary, YouTube. The streaming site was slapped with a $170 million sanction by the FTC for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). YouTube was found to have collected personal information from children under the age of 13 without obtaining parental consent and delivered targeted ads, which is illegal when it comes to children. 2020 — French CNIL France’s data protection authority, CNIL, fined Google €100 million for violating the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The fine was imposed because Google failed to provide clear and transparent information about its data collection practices and did not obtain proper consent from users for personalized ads. This marked one of the first major fines under GDPR, and we’ve been consenting to cookies ever since. 2021 — French CNIL French authorities were just getting started with Google and imposed a huge €500 million fine on the tech company in 2021. It related to failing to comply with a ruling regarding the payment to news publishers for the use of their content. The regulator criticized Google for limiting the scope of negotiations by excluding press images and not discussing proper compensation. 2021 — Italian Competition Auth.'}, {'title': 'iOS 18 is just days away – here’s the full Apple list of new features coming to your iPhone', 'link': 'https://www.techradar.com/phones/ios-18-is-just-days-away-heres-the-full-apple-list-of-new-features-coming-to-your-iphone', 'date': '2024-09-13', 'short_description': 'Apple has revealed the full list of everything that’s coming to iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, and there are a few surprises inside.', 'content': \"Plenty of secret new features to uncover When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. For months, Apple’s iOS 18 operating system has been hyped up as the most significant iPhone software update in years. Now, Apple has shared the complete list of upgrades found in iOS 18, and it contains a few surprises that Apple has kept quiet up until now. The complete list can be found in a PDF on Apple’s website, and there’s also a separate PDF containing the list of changes coming to iPadOS 18 (right now, there doesn’t seem to be a PDF for new features in macOS Sequoia). The documents contain detailed breakdowns of the operating systems’ features, with everything sorted into categories for easy reading. There are plenty of familiar features that Apple has talked about before. For instance, the iOS 18 list begins with Apple Intelligence, with sections for writing tools, the Image Playground, Siri, Genmoji, and more. Many of the features will be familiar if you have followed Apple’s announcements and third-party round-ups (such as our own). Still, it’s worth browsing the articles to see exactly what you can expect and how you might be able to make use of the new features. That said, among all the previously discussed features are a few that have received very little airtime. For example, MacRumors points out that the following features are either relatively unknown or have not been revealed by Apple before: While these are mostly small changes, it is interesting to see some of the lesser-known additions and updates that will be available in iOS 18. Apple says its new operating systems, including iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, will be available to download on Monday, September 16, when you’ll be able to try out everything new for yourself.

(AP Photo) Afghanistan\\'s historic first Test match against New Zealand was abandoned without a ball being bowled. The match is the eighth Test in cricket\\'s 147-year, 2,549-match history to be abandoned without a ball being bowled. New Zealand head to Galle for the first of two Tests against Sri Lanka, while Afghanistan take on South Africa in a three match ODI series in the United Arab Emirates. Afghanistan\\'s one-off Test against New Zealand has joined some select company in the sport\\'s history — for all the wrong reasons. The match, scheduled to take place at the Shahid Vijay Singh Pathik Sport Complex in Greater Noida, near Delhi, became just the eighth match in the format\\'s history to be abandoned without a ball being bowled. There have been 2,549 Test matches in the format\\'s 147-year history. The first ever Test scheduled between the sides looked doomed from the start due to steady rain for over two weeks in the region. A combination of falling rain and, when that stopped, a persistently wet outfield, ended any hope of play. It was Afghanistan\\'s third Test in 2024, following one-off matches against Ireland and a 10-wicket loss to Sri Lanka. There was controversy over New Zealand\\'s decision to play Afghanistan in a Test, after Australia withdrew from a three match T20 series on government advice. \"Over the past 12 months, CA has continued to consult with the Australian government on the situation in Afghanistan,\" Cricket Australia said upon announcing the withdrawal from the series. \"The government\\'s advice is that conditions for women and girls in Afghanistan are getting worse. \"For this reason, we have maintained our previous position and will postpone the bilateral series against Afghanistan.\" Afghanistan is the only full member of the International Cricket Council to not have a women\\'s cricket team after it was disbanded following the Taliban takeover in 2021. Most of the women who should be playing cricket for Afghanistan have resettled in Australia since the Taliban took over the country, but they are disappointed by a lack of support from the International Cricket Council. Australia has continued to play Afghanistan in World Cups. The team will play three one-day internationals against South Africa in the United Arab Emirates beginning September 18. Afghanistan play their home matches abroad due to security concerns for touring teams. The Afghan board preferred Greater Noida — which was set to host its first ever Test match — over two other venues in India because of its proximity to Delhi, which made travelling from Kabul easier. New Zealand next plays a two-Test series against Sri Lanka in Galle on September 18. It then returns to India for a three-Test series against India in October. Rain is the bane of a cricketer\\'s existence. (Getty Images: Morgan Hancock) The first such instance of a game being abandoned without a ball being bowled was an Ashes Test at Old Trafford, Manchester, in 1890. Ashes Tests have been affected three times in total by the weather making play impossible. The second instance also occurred at Old Trafford in 1938, with the third taking place in Melbourne in 1970. New Zealand has featured in abandoned Tests three times, including the most recent, which took place nearly 26 years ago. New Zealand\\'s home Test against India was abandoned on day three because of persistent rain at Carisbrook Oval in Dunedin in December 1998. A Test at Carisbrook was also abandoned in 1989 against Pakistan — perhaps not unusually given the city of Dunedin on New Zealand\\'s South Island has around 167 days of rain per year, for about 973mm of rain per year. England\\'s 1990 Test at Georgetown in Guyana was also abandoned without a ball being bowled. Two ODI\\'s were scheduled for what would have been the fourth and fifth days, with the first of those also being abandoned without a ball being bowled.

Urging Sharif to be more grounded, the Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Federal Territories) said his shallow argument was reflective of his “shallow thinking”. “Enough with using religion to make arguments,” she said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, yesterday. Dr Zaliha said pointing fingers and blaming others would not solve any problems. “If a disaster befalls oneself or a PAS-ruled state, then it is said to be a test, but if it occurs in other states, is it said to be the wrath (of God)?” she said. On Thursday, Sharif claimed the sinkhole incident that resulted in the death of an Indian tourist in Kuala Lumpur was a form of divine retribution arising from the actions taken by the Federal Territories Minister in Kuala Lumpur, as well as the construction of the Petronas Twin Towers in the city. On Aug 23, a 48-year-old woman identified as Vijayalaksmi from Kuppam, Andhra, India went missing after falling into an 8m-deep sinkhole on Jalan Masjid India. After nine days, the search and rescue operation was called off without any result. Social media users also took umbrage at Sharif’s statement, slamming him as insensitive and totally out of line. They said PAS makes its own rules, and asked about the frequent floods in Kelantan. “Do not politicise a tragedy as it is very insensitive to the victim, and also the people who fought hard to save her,” @kumari..thevan posted on X. “There is no empathy whatsoever for the tragedy but quick to politicise it for their own benefit,” said Facebook user William Goh. “When it affects them, they call it a test from God. When it affects others, they call it retribution,” said @Saiful_Farisin on X. Tags / Keywords: Zaliha Mustafa , PAS Youth , Mohd Sharif Mohd Azhari , Sinkhole , Jalan Masjid India Report it to us.

Grandmothers can have a sweetness to them,” says Mark Kroeker, the designer behind the New York-based luxury jewelry brand Tejen. However “the sweetness that inspired the Rock Sugar collection, takes on a more subversive, indulgent meaning… like a sugar rush. Something irresistibly decadent.” In the designer’s latest collection, 18kt gold is frosted with white diamonds or spun into a sugar stick, creating earrings that look as if they are ready to be dipped into coffee. Although more intricate and worked than previous collections, the pieces reflect a coherent design evolution that results in an innovative aesthetic that’s never cloying. He enjoys the duality of the collection: “Rock Sugar is tough, but sweet. Street, but also very pretty; sleek but messy; smart but needlessly decadent,” he muses. “Subversive, but elegant.” The Sugar Stick earrings by Tejen, 18kt recycled gold and conflict-free diamonds. For me, the standout piece in the collection is its most straightforward; the Opal Candy Bowl ring which features an Australian white opal nestled in the bonbonnière of a generously formed gold ring. As the cool opals gleam against the warm gold, the designer explains that he was drawn to the gemstones “like hard candy, for their dynamic light effects and mix of pastel color and playful, vivid sparks. They are stones that evoke both nostalgia and wonder, almost magical.” In its simplicity, the piece links back to the original elegant minimalism that produced the signature Ionic and Molten gold collections, itself an exploration of the dialog between ancient and modern born of Kroeker’s nomadic childhood spent in the US, Iran, and Turkey, and subsequent travels around the Middle East, Europe and the US. Rock sugar itself is thought to date back to Ancient times, first developed as ‘mishri’ in India and ‘nabat’ in Persia, a delicacy born of a slow process of crystallisation over time “a blend of patience, skill and beauty,” which according to Kroeker, is an apt metaphor for the craftsmanship behind his designs. Designer, Mark Kroeker, founder of Tejen The exposure to such diverse cultures awakened an artistic sensibility and after studying at Parsons School of Design, he launched his namesake label, Mark Kroeker / Lost Collective. Stints working with Donna Karan, LVMH and other design houses followed, but he became increasingly disillusioned with the pace and excess of the fashion industry: “it was a time of my life during which I did not feel satisfied. I was still creating beautiful products, but those products had a shelf life.” Driven by a desire to create luxury products in a more meaningful and less wasteful way, he created Tejen in 2015, a fine jewelry brand that takes a conscious approach to design by combining recycled gold, and devastation and conflict-free ethically sourced diamonds, with a slower, more considered ‘off-calendar’ schedule of drops. As he developed his new line, he thought back to his mother’s collection of antique jewelry from the Middle East: “they were pieces of history, each with its own special story for my parents,” and to the sculptural sterling silver and gold jewels he created to accent his own runway collections in the 2000s. The Opal Candy Drop pendant by Tejen, 18kt gold and ethically sourced diamonds. “As Tejen approaches its 10th anniversary, I see the brand evolving with more focus on unique one-of-a-kind pieces, objets d’art without limitations, for our collectors,” he finishes. With fine jewellery at its core, we could see the brand expand into other categories, always with the same slow and considered growth that has set it apart over the past decade.

Afghanistan's adopted home ground at Greater Noida, on New Delhi's outskirts, has been hit by persistent rain, forcing officials to call the match off without even staging the toss. However, there were also question marks about the venue, which was hosting its first-ever Test and has only basic drainage and facilities. Despite some sunshine on day one and two, the outfield remained soaked. Afghanistan are unable to host international matches because of the security situation at home. The last time an entire Test match was washed out was in December 1998, when New Zealand hosted India in Dunedin. An abandoned 1970 Test match between Australia and England in Melbourne gave birth to one-day international cricket. The two teams in that contest decided to play a 40-over contest on the originally scheduled fifth day once the weather had relented, and it was later officially recognised as the first-ever ODI. Unusual methods were used to dry the ground this week at Greater Noida with electric fans used on wet patches that were also dug up and replaced with new mud and grass. The tactics proved futile as unrelenting rain on day three, four and five pelted the ground, which was left with covers and puddles. Afghanistan have successfully played six Twenty20 and five one-day internationals at the Greater Noida venue since 2017. The country's cricket board said they chose it again over other options due its proximity to the Delhi airport. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has offered Afghanistan venues to train and host matches outside their troubled nation. Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) officials have been cautious about criticism, fearing it could spoil relations with the BCCI. Afghanistan have participated in nine prior Tests after getting five-day status in 2017 and made a bruising introduction in 2018 when they lost their debut match to India inside two days. They have improved in the years since, winning three Tests.

Lakeland Industries (LAKE) reported disappointing results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, ending July 31, which has led to a 14% drop in its stock price since the earnings announcement on September 4. The company posted sales of $38.5 million, a 17% increase year-over-year, bolstered by $6.3 million from recent acquisitions. However, these results missed consensus estimates by $1.4 million due to a 2.8% decline in organic revenue. Additionally, LAKE reported a net loss of $0.19 per share, significantly below expectations for earnings of $0.36 per share, largely due to costs associated with integrating new acquisitions and significant currency headwinds in Argentina. Despite these setbacks, I believe the market's reaction has been overly harsh, especially since the weaker-than-expected results were primarily due to shipment timing issues rather than any fundamental weakness in the business. A notable portion of the revenue shortfall resulted from the transition of large North American channel partner accounts to LineDrive, LAKE’s new industrial market representative, which caused some orders to slip into future quarters. With LineDrive actively building pipeline opportunities, LAKE anticipates channel sales to rebound in the second half. Similarly, delays in shipping significant fire orders from the Jolly Scarpe and Eagle Technical Products subsidiaries contributed to the shortfall but are expected to be recognized in the late third and early fourth quarters. Several additional factors also suggest that the second half of the fiscal year is shaping up to be much stronger than the first, particularly with the strategic acquisition of LHD Group in early July. LHD is a leading provider of firefighter turnout gear, accessories, and personal protective equipment, as well as cleaning, repair, and maintenance services, generating approximately $27 million in annual revenue. This acquisition significantly expands LAKE’s global fire services offerings and footprint, aligning with its growth strategy of making small, strategic, and quick acquisitions. LHD’s strong presence in Germany, Australia, and Hong Kong—some of the largest fire markets globally—broadens LAKE’s reach with an expanded range of high-quality rescue gear and maintenance services. LHD’s holistic approach to protective clothing maintenance also introduces an attractive recurring revenue stream. And along with its previous acquisitions of leading global structural firefighting helmet manufacturer Pacific Helmets NZ Limited of New Zealand last November and Italy and Romania-based Jolly Scarpe (a leading designer and producer of professional footwear for firefighting, military, police, and rescue bodies) in February, the integration of LHD allows LAKE to offer a comprehensive head-to-toe fire solution to a larger geographic audience. The acquisition also resolves a significant operational challenge LHD faced under its previous ownership. Specifically, production at LHD’s German entity had slowed dramatically due to liquidity issues, creating a multi-year backlog that dampened customer confidence. However, with LHD now under LAKE’s financially stable control, suppliers have resumed offering credit terms and discounts. Production has ramped up, and LAKE is focused on working down this backlog by the end of the fiscal year, which I believe will restore trust with customers and help drive revenue growth. If that’s not enough, LHD’s Hong Kong division recently secured a renewal with the Hong Kong Fire Department, with committed contract revenue increasing from $3.5 million to $5.3 million for the period from September 2024 to September 2025. These developments not only bolster LAKE’s confidence in LHD’s growth prospects but also provide a clear path to stronger second-half performance as LAKE leverages LHD’s renewed momentum and integrates it into the newly launched Lakeland Fire + Safety brand identity. I believe this consolidation of LAKE’s diverse portfolio under a unified brand underscores its commitment to providing comprehensive, innovative solutions for first responders and worker safety sectors, setting the stage for continued growth and market leadership. When you also consider the robust underlying performance of LAKE’s organic business, the outlook for the second half is even more encouraging. Specifically, its Latin American operations have excelled, with a 63% year-over-year sales increase in Q2 driven by a strong team that continues to seize new market opportunities, especially in woven products. The company is expanding its fire services and industrial product offerings in the region and has recently integrated its Mexican sales operations under the LatAm team, with Q2 sales in Mexico already up 58% year-over-year.

(Photo by Kirill KUDRYAVTSEV / AFP) ... [+] (Photo by KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP via Getty Images) The German statistics office has said the country saw a marked increase in recognition of foreign work qualifications in 2023. This is good news for both those looking to work in Germany, and for the German business community who have struggled in the past to recruit foreigners amid significant red tape. According to the statistics office, recognitions were up around a quarter from 2022, from 52,300 to 65,300. That is also more than double the 26,200 recognitions seen in 2016. The lion’s share of these recognitions were in medical professions. Qualifications from Turkey, Tunisia, Ukraine and India saw particular increases. Increasing foreign work qualifications has long been a part of Germany’s strategy to attract more foreign talent amid historic demographic changes. The government in recent years has been progressively lowering barriers to entry for foreign workers such as language requirements and salary thresholds. The country is facing labor shortages in many business sectors, with some regions of the country desperate for workers. Competition from other countries in the European Union and further abroad, as well as historic demographic decline which is seeing millions of people ageing out of the workforce and not being replaced, has put tremendous pressure on the authorities to bring in more people from outside. The medical sector is one of those severely threatened by the effects of demographic decline. The country is seeing precious few citizens becoming doctors or attaining other kinds of medical qualifications, and with many of those existing medical professionals nearing retirement, the healthcare sector - which already has over 10% of doctors coming from abroad - is only going to rely more on foreign workers. The dramatic increase in foreign work qualification recognition will be encouraging to those concerned about labor shortages. It adds to good news from earlier in 2024, when it was shown that Syrian refugees who had arrived around 2016 were experiencing increasing employment eight years after arriving. The country is still projected to be short hundreds of thousands of workers, however, and that gap could grow to seven million by 2035, according to official estimates. Economy minister Robert Habeck has described labor shortages as being the biggest obstacle to growth in the country. In that light, some are calling for more to be done to attract foreign workers at all skill levels - lowering bureaucratic barriers further, promoting language and integration courses and speeding up visa processes. Developments in German politics in recent years complicates matters. While Habeck and many others believe encouraging more migration is a necessary - it not totally sufficient - part of filling the massive labor gap, there are signs of growing resistance. Recently the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party (AfD) has chalked up historic results in state elections in East Germany - the region perhaps most threatened by demographic decline and rural emptying. This has triggered serious alarm among Germany’s business community. One prominent business leader warned ahead of the elections that the anti-immigration sentiment expressed by the AfD would only deter people from coming, thereby worsening labor shortages. Another said at the same time that the states of Thuringia and Saxony - which went on to see record votes for the AfD - stood on the edge of “economic catastrophe.” One state leader of the AfD, Thuringia’s Björn Höcke, has repeatedly targeted initiatives specifically designed to increase foreign participation in the German labor market. Addressing an umbrella group of small- and medium-sized enterprises dedicated to celebrating diversity in the workplace, Höcke said he wished them \"severe economic turbulence\" and would no longer buy from any of them. In response, Marie-Christine Ostermann, head of an SME group, called Höcke unpatriotic. “He wishes the economic downfall of family businesses, the backbone of the German economy,” wrote Ostermann. Voters will go to the polls in Brandenburg, another East German state, near the end of September. The AfD are widely predicted to replicate their recent electoral success there.'}, {'title': \"Trailer For Emile Hirsch's Gambling Crime Thriller DEAD MONEY\", 'link': 'https://geektyrant.com/news/trailer-for-emile-hirschs-gambling-crime-thriller-dead-money', 'date': '2024-09-13', 'short_description': 'Samuel Goldwyn Films has released the trailer for a gambling crime thriller titled Dead Money.

Android Circuit is here to remind you of a few of the many discussions around Android in the last seven days. You can also read my weekly digest of Apple news here on Forbes. The Samsung Galaxy S24 series smartphones (Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images) The expected launch of the next Galaxy S handsets may be four months away, but details on the big changes are starting to appear. As always, the camera will be an area where the South Korean company will be looking to beat the competition, and the S25 Ultra will not be an exception: \"According to the well-known tipster Ice Universe, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will receive an all-new 50-megapixel ultrawide camera featuring a brighter F/1.9 aperture lens. This upgrade represents a significant improvement from the 12-megapixel version found on the Galaxy S24 Ultra and should dramatically increase detail in ultrawide photos, especially in close-up macro shots.\" (Forbes). Before the Galaxy S25 series debuts, one last S24 handset is expected. The Fan Edition models have always targeted a lower price while maintaining high specifications. The latest leaks around the Galaxy S24 FE price have energised the community: \"On X/Twitter, a new post from @MysteryLupin claims that Samsung will launch the Galaxy S24 FE’s 8GB RAM + 128GB storage variant at €749. That’s €50 less than what the previous report had suggested. Furthermore, the tipster says the company will price the 8GB RAM + 256GB storage variant of the device at €809.\" (SamMobile). I had the chance to sit down with two of the Product team behind the second Fold from Google to talk about the design, hardware, and why it was essential to be a 9 Pro Fold and not a Fold 2: \"To us, it\\'s really important that this is a Pixel 9 Pro device. This device is for the consumer who wants the most from their phone and wants that next level of performance. The Nine Pro Fold is for that type of person: who wants the biggest screen on a phone, the thinnest foldable, and all of the great things? We built this phone, and it aligns to the Pixel 9 Pro.\" (Forbes). Writing on Weibo, OnePlus president Li Jie Louis confirmed that the next OnePlus flagship—the presumptively named OnePlus 13—will launch in October. Whether this is a Chinese only variant or a global model remains to be seen. In previous years OnePlus has released the former a few months before the latter: \"The latest generation of flagship chips to be launched next month is operated by a star team that once designed epoch-making PC chips. For the first time, it adopts a fully self-developed dual-core architecture to achieve all-round leapfrogging and leadership in mobile platform performance and achieve epoch-making performance experience.\" (Android Authority). Orders are being taken for the latest Android-powered gaming handheld from Retroid. The Android-powered device, which runs in landscape mode in a similar way to the Nintendo Switch, is one of the first to run a Snapdragon chipset, along with several features gamers look for: \"Additionally, Retroid has included an active cooling solution to keep the Pocket 5\\'s chipset cool under high load. Moreover, the Snapdragon 865 provides Bluetooth 5.1 and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity; however, Retroid has seemingly disabled the chipset\\'s modem. On top of that, the Pocket 5 features 3D Hall effect joysticks, analogue triggers and interchangeable button layouts.\" (NotebookCheck). A new subscription offer for what many see as a core Android service is now on sale. Google One Lite sits underneath the first “Google One Basic” that many consumers are on, offering double the free storage. It’s not widely available yet; it appears to be being tested in India: \"The new Lite tier, currently on offer with a one-month free trial, provides up to 30GB of cloud storage for Google Photos, Google Drive, and Gmail, doubling the initial 15 GB users get free just for signing up. Unlike Google One’s existing paid tiers, the new Lite subscription can’t be shared with other users—not that 30GB of storage would be enough to be worth sharing with friends and family anyway.\" (Forbes). Third-party app launchers are popular apps across the Android ecosystem, but Google has not opened up some of the key tools developers need to create a smooth experience. Now, the developers behind Smart Launcher, Niagara, Nova Launcher, and Lawnchair are working together to challenge Google to open up the gesture-based APIs \"Custom launchers routinely fall back on the archaic three-button navigation as key aspects of gesture navigation falter, stutter, or even hang randomly. This is because the default system launcher insists on managing app opening/closing animations and the “Recents” screen.

More than four weeks after US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research fired a salvo at the chairperson of India’s capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), Madhabi Puri Buch, the controversy over her alleged role in the story refuses to die down. Also read: Sebi’s toxic work culture, allegations against Chairperson Madhabi Buch spark Parliamentary inquiryIn a fresh attack, the Indian National Congress has alleged that Agora Advisory, a consulting business she owns 99% of, earned fees from regulated entities under Sebi’s purview even after her appointment to the regulator’s chair. It has held this up as a pointer to a conflict of interest, even as the said entities denied that they had sought preferential treatment from the capital-markets regulator. Earlier, India’s principal opposition party had accused Buch of receiving ₹2.17 crore in rental income from another regulated entity, which was under investigation for insider trading. According to a 10 August note from Hindenburg, Buch owned 100% of a Singapore-based consultancy Agora Partners from 2013 to 2022, a period that covered the time she was a full-time member of the Sebi Board, and transferred its ownership to her husband Dhaval Buch only on 16 March 2022, more than two weeks after taking charge as Sebi’s chairperson. Buch denied the charges of impropriety made by Hindenburg, but is yet to respond to the Congress’s allegations. This episode, however, cannot be dismissed as just another storm in a teacup. Sure, she has said that the existence of these consulting companies and her shareholding in them were an explicit part of her disclosures to Sebi and that she has nothing to hide. While this may well be so, the reality is that when it comes to regulators, the line between the personal and the public is very thin. Like Caesar’s wife, regulators must always be above suspicion. Importantly, they must also be seen as above suspicion. And that, unfortunately, is where Buch fails the test. Also read: Congress accuses Sebi’s Madhabi Buch of making crores from M&M, ICICI, Dr Reddy and 3 more listed companies via Agora Sebi has also said it has adequate internal mechanisms to address conflicts of interest. Still, it does the Sebi chair no credit to remain at the helm while under a cloud. Suspicions over any unofficial role she may have played after she joined Sebi have come to expose the regulator’s reputation to risk. This is unfortunate. It has implications for how the Indian equity market is seen by investors globally, and given the market’s role in capital allocation, for the whole economy. We need a complete probe of all allegations. Sebi’s competence is not in doubt, as the Supreme Court observed this January, but we must ensure that regulatory officials function without fear or favour, and that is best done if Buch steps aside till such time that her name is cleared. More importantly, we must use this controversy as a trigger for larger reforms of the system to rule out potential conflicts of interest in the future. First, to strengthen safeguards meant to ensure those who helm financial regulators cannot earn from any job held or for-profit role elsewhere, their holdings should not only be made public, but also sealed off and held in blind trusts as long as they have public duties to fulfil. Second, we should revisit the current protocol of appointments being made solely by the executive. Instead, these decisions could be made by a bipartisan body, such as the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, and/or require the approval of Parliament.

The workers\\' first strike since 2008 began just weeks after new CEO Kelly Ortberg was brought on in August to restore faith in the planemaker after a door panel blew off a nearly new 737 MAX jet in mid-air in January. Roughly 30,000 International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) members who produce Boeing\\'s 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas voted on their first full contract in 16 years, overwhelmingly rejecting the deal and favouring a strike. \"This is about respect, this is about addressing the past and this is about fighting for our future,\" said Jon Holden, who headed the negotiations for Boeing\\'s largest union, before announcing the vote result on Thursday evening. \"We strike at midnight,\" said the union leader who had agreed to the just-defeated deal, as members in the union hall cheered and chanted: \"Strike! Strike! Strike!\" Boeing said late on Thursday the vote sent a clear message that the tentative deal it reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to members. \"We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement,\" the planemaker said in a statement. The deal included a general wage increase of 25 per cent, a $3,000 signing bonus and a pledge to build Boeing\\'s next commercial jet in the Seattle area, provided the program was launched within the four years of the contract. Although IAM leadership recommended last Sunday that its members accept the contract, many workers had responded angrily, arguing for the originally demanded 40-per-cent pay rise and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus. \"We\\'re going to get back to the table as quickly as we can,\" Holden told reporters, without saying how long he thought the strike would last or when talks would resume. \"This is something that we take one day at a time, one week at a time.\" Workers have been protesting all week in Boeing factories in the Seattle area that assemble Boeing\\'s MAX, 777 and 767 jets. Boeing shares closed up 0.9 per cent on Thursday before the vote results were announced but are down 36 per cent this year on concerns over safety, production and a $60-billion debt burden. A strike presents Boeing with multiple challenges: it will need to decide how to respond at the bargaining table, after saying it had offered everything it could. It also must find a way to secure factories full of extremely valuable, partially built planes without union workers to do the job. A letter to workers on Wednesday, Ortberg said \"a strike would put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together.\" If prolonged, a strike would weigh not only on Boeing\\'s financials, but on airlines that depend on the planemaker\\'s jets and suppliers who manufacture parts and components for its aircraft. Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said on Friday that Boeing\\'s 737 MAX deliveries to his airline appeared to be \"delayed a little bit\" even before the strike announcement because of regulatory scrutiny after the Alaska Airlines incident and supply chain issues affecting the broader industry. \"There\\'s nothing official yet, but I think the indication is, or the expectation is, that it\\'s going to be a little bit later,\" he said in an interview in Sydney. According to a pre-vote note from TD Cowen, a 50-day strike could cost Boeing an estimated $3 billion to $3.5 billion of cash flow. The Boeing workers\\' last strike in 2008 shuttered plants for 52 days and hit revenue by an estimated $100 million per day. Add some “good” to your morning and evening.

(File Photo: REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas) This audio is generated by an AI tool. MUMBAI: Jeweller Rakesh Bachhawat is expecting a gold rush for his shop in the upcoming wedding and festive season. For some time, business at his store on the outskirts of the Indian financial capital of Mumbai had been sluggish – but not anymore. The federal government announced in its budget two months ago that it would cut the import duty on gold from 15 per cent to 6 per cent. The move in July helped ease record-high prices and boost domestic demand of the rare commodity. “A lot of people are investing in gold and I expect a 10 to 20 per cent increase in business growth this season. I'm 100 per cent certain of this,” said Bacchawat. Local media has since reported as much as a 30 per cent jump in sales for some jewellers. Indians buy physical gold in the form of jewellery, bars and coins. It is a form of investment for some, and a means of storing wealth for others who do not have bank accounts. Gold consumption in the world’s second-largest gold-buying market took a hit last year, when demand was weighed down by high prices. It fell 3 per cent on the year to around 750 tonnes. After July’s adjustment on import duties, the outlook is now more promising. The World Gold Council estimates that the changes made in the budget could lead to consumers in India demanding at least 50 tonnes more of the precious metal in the second half of this year. India's gold consumption in 2024 is now projected to hit up to 850 tonnes. “We believe that the quarter of October, November and December (this year) will perhaps be one of the most significant consumption quarters that we would have witnessed in a long period of time,” said the trade association’s India CEO Sachin Jain. Gold in India is currently trading at about 73,000 rupees (US$870) per 10 grams. Industry insiders said that if not for the lower import duty, the rate could have been as high as around US$950. Industry officials said the government slashed the import duty on gold to accomplish two things – reduce the price to boost domestic demand, and curb smuggling activities by making it less lucrative. Official data showed that gold smuggling has been on the rise in India, with an intricate network of smugglers illegally sneaking the metal into the country via land, sea, and air routes. In 2023 alone, authorities seized more than 3,900kg of gold in the highest number of cases in at least three years. “Now, with the customs duty getting dropped to the current levels - and when you smuggle there is a cost, it doesn't come for free - I think the arbitrage reduces to a very small level, which wouldn't be incentive enough,” said Jain. Arbitrage refers to the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset in different markets to achieve a certain profit. Businesses, too, said the tax reduction is a move in the right direction. “We are very thankful that finally they have done this duty cut, and this will help the organised trade to scale up much faster all over India,” said Colin Shah, founder and managing director of Kama Jewelry, a retailer and exporter in the western suburb of Andheri. Nevertheless, concerns remain that gold prices could suddenly jump on factors beyond India’s control, including geopolitical tensions, interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and the upcoming US elections.

Honda CI is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) by the Japanese manufacturer that “enables mutual understanding between machines and people,” said Honda, and its joint research with the Indian institutes of technology is aimed at advancing the underlying technologies of cooperative intelligence, with the possibility of future applications for technologies which reduce traffic collisions and enable automated driving, it said. The Japanese manufacturer is aiming to make mobility ubiquitous, collision-free and stress-free, and it is currently also conducting proof-of-concept demonstrations of its CI-powered micro-mobility vehicle in Japan, in Joso City in the Ibraki prefecture. Joint research themes have been set by Honda and the IITs, such as recognition of the surrounding environment and cultivation of cooperative behaviour, and Honda associates and IIT professors will jointly engage with IIT students for the planning, designing, developing and testing of these technologies which will be carried out outside of laboratory confines. Honda is aiming to have zero traffic fatalities involving its automobiles and motorcycles by 2050 This will then allow research and development to proceed with greater freedom, and enable Honda to work with the IITs in a more flexible environment with deeper exchange of insights, the manufacturer said. Through its collaboration with the IITs, Honda aims to conduct its verification of driving assistance systems and automated driving technologies in the suburbs of Delhi and Mumbai. Specifically because of the numerous variations in road systems and its large population of road users which pose a complex traffic environment for AI to predict, conducting the technology verification in this environment is aimed at refining the underlying technologies of Honda’s cooperative intelligence for their future application in driver assistance and automated driving technologies for various regions in the world, including India. Through its pursuit of of joint research programmes with IIT professors and students who specialise in AI and automated driving technologies, Honda aims to expedite the R&D of CI and contribute to the growth of researchers who will play roles in future AI research by providing them with practical research opportunities, said Honda. Honda’s aforementioned aim of achieving a collision-free road user society is also the goal of the Japanese manufacturer’s plan to have Honda Sensing 360 reach all major markets by 2030, towards its broader objective of achieving zero traffic collision fatalities involving Honda motorcycles and automobiles worldwide by 2050.

The amendments align with the recommendations put forward by the expert committee set up to encourage companies to return to India. The amended rules apply when a foreign holding company (incorporated outside India) enters into a merger or amalgamation with an Indian company (incorporated in India) that is a wholly owned subsidiary. Companies must now obtain approval only from the RBI. Previously, they were required to obtain approval from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The transferee Indian company must make the application to the Central Government under section 233 of the Companies Act, 2013. The same company must also submit interim reports to Central Government and on conclusion of investigation a final report to the Government, as it awaits approval. However, each of the companies involved must file the declaration of insolvency, under rule 25 of the Companies (Compromises, Arrangements and Amalgamations) Rules, 2016. These provisions come into force from September 17, 2024. Companies moving their domicile to foreign countries is called flipping or externalization. In such cases, companies can also transfer the entire ownership of the company to a foreign entity. An Economic Survey released by the Indian government for 2022-23 noted this phenomenon as a major concern. The survey noted “many Indian companies have been getting headquartered overseas, especially in destinations with favourable legal environments and taxation policies,”. Thus, the Government set up a expert Committee in March 2023 to create a roadmap to prevent this flipping. The Committee also acknowledged the concern of “brain drain” and provided recommendations to encourage “reverse flipping” i.e. bringing startups and companies back to India. The committee submitted a report to the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA). It laid out over thirty recommendations across a range of domains such as taxation, infrastructure, company law, dispute resolution etc. to encourage startups to relocate to the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City). One of these recommendations included exempting mergers from NCLAT approvals. It noted that “reverse flipping” may require mergers and acquisitions (M&As). These were earlier subject to approvals from the National Company Law Tribunal or the RBI. It is recommended that this be limited to the RBI to ease the process of mergers. In recent times, multiple companies have shifted their domicile back to India. Fintech company Groww moved from the US back to India in March 2024. Similarly, Pinelabs recently received approval from the Singapore court to ‘reverse-flip’ to India. PhonePe’s parent company Walmart paid nearly the Indian government $1 billion in tax to shift its startup’s headquarters from Singapore to India. These flips could potentially attribute to the companies’ desire to be listed on the Indian stock exchange. Some have even claimed that startups based in India are more likely to obtain funding than those based in foreign countries.

Sean O'Neill Select a question above or ask something else The Skift Global Forum 2024 will explore critical themes in the travel industry, including post-pandemic recovery trends, future hotel growth strategies, and the U.S.'s preparedness to host major sporting events. Discussions will cover various hotel segments, regional expansions, and the role of sports tourism in driving travel industry growth. Where will future hotel development growth come from? How are hotels using technology to sell more than just rooms? Do U.S. officials and travel marketers have good gameplans for hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the Summer Olympics in 2028, the Cricket World Cup, and other major sporting events to come? These and other subjects will be top of our minds as we hear from leaders at Marriott, Wyndham, MGM Resorts at the Skift Global Forum in New York on September 17 to 19. The theme of Skift Global Forum 2024 is “Travel’s Great Renewal (or Reckoning).” We’re interested in knowing what is normalizing back to 2019 levels and whether anything has changed for good. Perhaps people continue to value travel more post-pandemic than they did before. Maybe there are tangible signs that consumers are protecting vacation spending in their discretionary budgets, preferring to cut other types of spending first. Similarly, corporate travel remains down about 18% from 2019 levels when you adjust for inflation. Do booking patterns on weeknights suggest that “blended trips” — where vacation time is added onto business — still happen at elevated levels? We’ll likely ask Marriott president and CEO Anthony Capuano some versions of those questions. Hotel groups have many possible sources of growth, but which ones are they prioritizing? We’ll ask Wyndham president and CEO Geoff Ballotti what he anticipates for his company, the world’s largest franchisor, and for the industry broadly. Wyndham has a deep presence in economy and midscale hotels as measured by room count. But its 25 brands span the full range, including upper-upscale brands like Wyndham Grand and Dolce. Rivals Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt doubled down on extended-stay as a category in the past couple of years with new brands. Will the extended-stay category continue to be a hot segment, and what tailwinds drive that interest? Lifestyle and boutique hotels generate a lot of buzz, such as with Hilton buying Graduate Hotels and Hyatt buying Standard International. Luxury and ultra-luxury are also key topics. We’ll ask Capuano about Marriott’s plans to expand in this space and how new products like The Ritz Carlton Yacht Collection are performing. But betting on the middle class is also popular. Marriott has recently added midscale brands like StudioRes, Four Points Express by Sheraton, City Express by Marriott in Latin America, and its as yet unnamed brand Project Mid-T. Hilton has added two midscale brands, as did IHG. Hyatt is also moving downscale. What’s driving this dynamic? Geographically, where’s the growth? Marriott placed at least one recent bet on Latin America with its City Express acquisition. It is competing with IHG, Hilton, and Accor to expand in China and India. Japan has become incredibly popular with international tourists, while Saudi Arabia and the UAE are treating tourism like it’s the new oil. Sports tourism has become a growth driver for the travel industry. However, U.S. restrictions and delays in issuing visas in some countries have held back the full potential of international visitation to the U.S., which will be playing host. We’ll ask MGM Resorts president and CEO Bill Hornbuckle whether he thinks the U.S. is prepared. Are visa wait times dropping? Are passports being issued more quickly? Are steps being taken for more sports diplomacy? We’ll ask U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Verma. Similarly, are hotels doing enough to tap into rising interest in experiences? We’ll hear about a study that was done in a partnership between McKinsey & Company and Skift Research. Activities, sports events, music concerts, and other experiences are moving higher in the travel decision-making funnel and influencing which destinations travelers are going to. How are hotel loyalty programs adapting to move beyond points rewards to tap into people’s interests and desire for experiential moments? We’ll ask Capuano and Hornbuckle. Many travelers decide whether a company or destination is worth investing their money and time in based on how it treats guests, especially repeat ones. Which companies and destinations have transparency as an operating principle? And what are the best ways of being transparent? We’re interested in how they handle claims about engaging with local communities, .\"}, {'title': 'In Asia, Zero Waste Is Proving to Be a Climate Solution', 'link': 'https://thediplomat.com/2024/09/in-asia-zero-waste-is-proving-to-be-a-climate-solution/', 'date': '2024-09-13', 'short_description': 'Decentralized and community-led zero waste practices are a low-hanging fruit in addressing the climate crisis.', 'content': 'Decentralized and community-led zero waste practices are a low-hanging fruit in addressing the climate crisis. Food waste at a market in Bangkok, Thailand, Oct. 6, 2013. It’s not every day that you see the words “zero waste” and “climate” in the same sentence. Zero waste practitioners, both individuals and civil society organizations, vie for individual lifestyle change while also calling for a systems change in the way things are produced and consumed. Sadly, big plastic, oil, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) businesses, on the other hand, push for programs that often will benefit them more than actually mitigating climate change. Decentralized and community-led zero waste practices are a low-hanging fruit in addressing the climate crisis. While allied with campaigns to break free from plastic and stop waste burning, the zero waste campaign also meshes with climate mitigation and adaptation. You simply cannot go zero waste without having a positive impact on the climate. The waste sector is the third largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions, a third of the global total, according to the “Global Methane Assessment: Benefits and Costs of Mitigating Methane Emissions.” The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) report placed methane reduction as a key climate target policy in 2021, prior to the launch of the Global Methane Pledge. Methane is a short-lived greenhouse gas responsible for one-fifth of man-made global warming. It degrades in 12 years, making methane reduction initiatives and efforts an important component in any climate mitigation policies. According to the report “Methane Matters: A Comprehensive Approach to Methane Mitigation,” methane emissions from the waste sector are produced primarily from the breakdown of biodegradable materials in dumpsites, landfills, or sewage treatment environments that restrict oxygen. Looking at the waste composition in Asia alone, with over 50 percent organic waste, we see why waste segregation and organic composting will go a long way in keeping the temperature increase below the 1.5 degrees threshold, a target set in the Paris Agreement and signed by 195 countries. These two activities alone can reduce methane emissions from landfills by 92 percent. This is where government intervention comes into play. At the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Azerbaijan this year, climate financing is on top of the agenda, and next year’s conference in Brazil will see the submission of new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that will serve as roadmaps for national climate action. As countries prepare for these upcoming summits, the need to redirect financing and national strategies toward zero waste is critical. Countries in Asia are moving in this direction, with some of them leading and others taking on lessons learned and applying best practices of neighboring countries. One such group is the Zero Waste Cities Network, a network of local government officials and zero waste advocates in Asia formed during the International Zero Waste Cities Conference held in Manila in 2023 to advance sustainable waste management in their countries. This year, the Philippine chapter of the Network was formally launched. The newly elected officers of the Network are taking it a step further, recognizing the importance of mainstreaming zero waste practices not just as an optimal solution to waste management problems such as the plastic crisis, but as a climate mitigating measure. The timing could not have been more apt with Asia’s recent experiences of the wrath of climate change, alternating El Niño and La Niña at an unprecedented rate. There are zero-waste cities and communities in Asia that serve as living examples of the transformative power of zero waste. Siqujor, the Philippines’ first Zero Waste province, has banned small plastic bottles and created a glass bottle-refill system, while San Fernando in Pampanga, the Philippines, has achieved a 90 percent waste diversion rate from landfills. Kerala, India; Kamikatsu, Japan; Bandung, Indonesia; and Penang, Malaysia – The list of cities and communities goes on beyond the borders of Asia, with an even longer list of innovative zero-waste initiatives catering and responding to the actual needs of the community. Seeing these successes, the Zero Waste Cities Network in the Philippines made the decision to urge the Philippine Climate Change Commission to include zero waste into the National Climate Action Plan (NCAP) and the NDCs and institutionalize the environment and natural resources offices in every local government. The Network is also proposing to collaborate with the Commission in developing training programs for local governments to integrate zero waste strategies into their local Climate Action Plans. The Network is also calling on the Commission to support the legislation of the Magna Carta for Waste Workers that will safeguard the rights of the workers, a key component .'}, {'title': 'International Schools Show Confusion About Advanced Placement', 'link': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/rayravaglia/2024/09/13/international-schools-show-confusion-about-advanced-placement/', 'date': '2024-09-13', 'short_description': 'For schools in countries with national curriculum boards, AP seems like the US standard. Elite universities have been pulling away from AP. Students are losing out.', 'content': 'International schools present Advanced Placement as a gold-standard US national curriculum; elite ... [+] universities seem to disagree. For schools in countries with national curriculum boards, few realities produce more cognitive dissonance than the fact that the United States lacks a national curriculum. This is especially true in a country like India, where schools define themselves in terms of which curriculum board they follow and where board exam results play an essential role in the lives of students, ranging from university admissions to serving as national identity cards. With the best schools constantly jockeying for position in national rankings, such as those done by Education World Magazine, it is not a surprise that some schools have glommed onto Advanced Placement as a de facto US National Curriculum and present it to their students and families as being such. While such actions may be understandable from a market point of view they run counter to the way elite universities have come to perceive Advanced Placement. The College Board introduced the Advanced Placement program in 1952 to provide students from top prep schools with a vehicle for studying college-level material and receiving credit for that study based on end-of-year examinations. A pilot program was launched with ten subjects, and in 1954, around 530 high school students took the exam. The program was rolled out nationally in 1955. The number of students and schools participating in the program has grown steadily over the years with over one million students taking AP examinations by 2006. In 2024, the number of exams being offered approached 40, with over 5,000,000 exams being taken annually. While the above numbers might justify the view that the AP is the gold standard for the US curriculum, the treatment of the exam over these years suggests that it is anything but. Two historical comparisons will illustrate this point. In the 1994-95 edition of the Stanford Bulletin, then called Courses and Degrees, a long section on credit for Advanced Placement begins by stating, “Generally, credit is given for an AP score of 4 or 5.” This is in contrast to the guidance of the College Board, which has consistently held that a score of 3 should be considered passing. The Bulletin shows a table of examinations for which credit can be earned by exam in the following sixteen subject areas: US Government, US History, Art History, Studio Art, Biology, Chemistry, Comparative Government, Computer Science, Economics, English, World Languages, European History, Music, Physics, Psychology, and Spanish. By the 2018-19 edition, the list of acceptable subject areas has been reduced to five: Mathematics, Chemistry, Computer Science, World Languages, and Physics. Also, the International Baccalaureate exams have also been added to the table for these same subjects. In the 2024-25 edition, the list of subject areas remains the same, but the number of different types of examinations being accepted for credit has been expanded to include eight additional examination boards. In the 2006-07 Bulletin for Yale University, in the section entitled Criteria for the Awarding of Acceleration Credit, the following ten subject areas are listed: Biology, Chemistry, World Languages, Computer Science, English, History, History of Art, Mathematics, Music, and Physics. By the 2024-25 edition, the list of subject areas has been reduced to six subjects: English, World Languages, History of Art, Mathematics, Music, and Physics. As with Stanford University, the trajectory of acceptable examinations has been trending down even while the College Board has been expanding the number and types of examinations available. Whereas Stanford and Yale once gave credit for well over 70% of the Advanced Placement subjects available, they now do so for less than 30%. This is hardly a ringing endorsement of Advanced Placement as being a unique standard of quality. Even if the Advanced Placement standard is tarnished, there is still the question of whether adopting that standard will boost student outcomes when they apply to college. Here is where things get tricky. The College Board has never presented Advanced Placement as an admissions tool; the SAT and the SAT II have occupied that role. Even in the current historical moment where traditional holistic admissions have been disrupted, there remains an understanding among admissions officers that the presence or absence of Advanced Placement says more about the ambitions of a school than it does about the academic ability of its students. The most telling statement, however, comes from Columbia University. In their guidance for international students, they explicitly state that: “Columbia accepts all secondary school curricula (e.g., International Baccalaureate, Cambridge A Levels, National School curricula, etc.), and applications are reviewed within the context of your curriculum.” By this they mean that they will treat such things the way .'}, {'title': 'Insider Sale: COO Amin Sabzivand Sells 1,500 Shares of Sezzle Inc (SEZL)', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insider-sale-coo-amin-sabzivand-230059003.html', 'date': '2024-09-13', 'short_description': 'The transaction was reported in a recent SEC Filing.

Structured Leisure Time\", 'link': 'https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-structure-leisure-time-to-get-most-benefits', 'date': '2024-09-13', 'short_description': 'Leisure is absolutely not a waste of time.', 'content': 'Login Login People who see leisure as a waste of time are more likely to experience anxiousness, depressive feelings, and stress, according to one study. Yes, finding leisure time wasteful actually hurts our mental well-being. The study goes on to state that even without alternative plans, these individuals still didn\\'t enjoy non-productive leisure activities and generally didn\\'t find much fun in their lives. Though we need between two to five hours of free time daily for optimal functioning, the problem with leisure, to those of us who are achievement-oriented, is that we don\\'t know what to do during that free time. We think that we have to be productive 100% of the time. Of course, asking an achievement-oriented person to just snap their fingers and force themselves to adopt the relaxing activities others seem to enjoy would essentially be asking them to get a personality transplant. But there is a way to nestle comfortably in that sweet spot between \"languid leisure\" and \"I need to accomplish something.\" Here\\'s what I suggest if you\\'re trying to embrace leisure time. You\\'ve heard it\\'s all in the mind as a way to dismiss others\\' experiences. Well, this is partly in your mind, and that\\'s the good news. When we get your head on board, we get you on board. Even if technically you are supposed to be doing leisure for the sake of leisure, let\\'s start with baby steps and hijack it with an aim or goal. What will this leisurely activity help you with? Maybe it\\'s intertwined with your goal of getting healthier, or you\\'re exploring places so you improve your photography skills. If you really enjoy an activity and happen to enjoy other outcomes alongside that, that\\'ll make it easier for you to prioritize your leisure time. Human beings are a bit more complex than only having singular motivations, feelings, or benefits from something. You could get curious about how your friends, neighbors, or colleagues enjoy their leisure time. Or if that makes you feel uncomfortable, how about looking at other cultures? In the study mentioned above, researchers found that people from India saw leisure as wasteful, locating this within a diligent work ethic and economic imperative. At the other end of the spectrum were the French. Whether you love getting lost in Emily In Paris or are enthralled by Cole Porter’s song I Love Paris, it might benefit you to ask yourself \"What would the French do?\" just as an exercise in curiosity. Or, \"What would I do differently if I were in Paris, to make use of my time there?\" And then take it from there. Our brains love to imagine catastrophe—and when we\\'re in the thick of imagining, our brains believe it\\'s real. These anxieties are abstract, and when abstract, they take on a life of their own. A trick to get around it is to literally ask yourself, \"What\\'s the worst that could happen?\" Face these fears and you\\'ll realize that the world will not end if you take a 20-minute walk in the middle of the day. In fact, you may find that it helps you reclaim more time in your day. Many Type-A people see sleep as unnecessary. But the science of sleep says otherwise: Besides helping your cells to repair and renew, sleep clears junk information from your brain, integrates information and consolidates memories, and also provides a safe space to process traumas. And that\\'s just the beginning of a very comprehensive slew of functions sleep fulfills. It is definitely not redundant or a waste of time. We are just learning to respect sleep as a cornerstone of our lives. What if we could respect leisure as an equally important cornerstone? Taking breaks is about spending time to buy back exponentially more time and peace of mind. That pause helps us to strategize and respond wisely, instead of reacting from a place of fear. How about acknowledging leisure\\'s role in nurturing your most important relationships, taking care of your body, and indulging your curiosity in other parts of life? Because the more areas of life we expose ourselves to, the more raw material we have to be creative. Not to mention, resting or leisure time (meaning, not working) activates the Default Mode Network in our brain1, which is absolutely essential for creative breakthroughs, whether to create solutions or innovations. While many people fear becoming lax or undisciplined with leisure activities, the truth is, for many people, it will take a lot of discipline to become indolent and hedonistic. While \"unproductive\" leisure activities without aims are often associated with hanging out with one\\'s friends, sitting on a beach and doing nothing, or watching TV, maybe we have to examine these beyond their abstract categories. For instance, are you actually watching shows you love (and even learn from), or just numbing your brain? If you\\'re watching a show you enjoy with others and then talking about it over a meal later, that means multiple benefits. And maybe you don\\'t like sitting on a beach, so a walk or picnic may suffice.

But the encounter you would have feared most was with ghostly figures standing at the side of the road, dressed in rags and shaking rattles or bells to warn of their approach. Covered in sores and missing fingers and toes, they would beg you for alms, which you might give them before hastily rushing off, covering your mouth and nose with your cloak lest you contract their horrible affliction. These wretched figures were the lepers, sufferers of the dreaded disease of leprosy. Occupying the lowest rung of the Medieval caste system, lepers were declared legally dead by the church and banished to the margins of society, forbidden to interact with the non-infected and forced to beg by the roadside. Such was the stigma associated with this disease that to this day, the term “leper” remains synonymous with social ostracism. But just what is leprosy, anyway? Is it really as contagious as Medieval people believed? Does it really make your fingers and toes drop off? And is it still around today? Let’s find out as we dive into the fascinating history of one of humanity’s most feared – and misunderstood – diseases. Just when leprosy first began to afflict humans is unknown. The term leprosy, from the Greek lepra or “scale,” has been around since at least Biblical times, with Leviticus 13:9-33 describing the disease as: “Sometimes a skin disease will spread all over a person’s body, covering the skin from head to foot. The priest must look at that person’s whole body. If the priest sees that the skin disease covers the whole body and that it has turned all the skin white, the priest must announce that the person is clean. But if the skin is raw, that person is not clean. When the priest sees the raw skin, he must announce that the person is unclean. The raw skin is not clean. It is leprosy.” However, it is generally recognized by scholars that the biblical affliction Tzaraath, often translated into English as “leprosy” refers not to the physical disease leprosy as we know it today but rather a spiritual condition brought about by ritual impurity, which could disfigure not only the human body but also clothing and walls or other surfaces in the home. And even if the term does refer to an actual disease, it is unclear whether this is actual leprosy or one of many other common skin diseases like eczema, psoriasis, vitiligo, or scleroderma. Similar descriptions in Ancient Egyptian and Ancient Indian texts are equally ambiguous. Whatever the case, the oldest confirmed case of actual leprosy dates from the 2nd millennium B.C.E., discovered in a skeleton unearthed in Balathal, Rajasthan, in 2009. The oldest case in the West was found in a skeleton unearthed that same year in Jerusalem, dating from the 1st Century C.E. Based on this and other DNA evidence, epidemiologists believe leprosy spread from the Indian subcontinent to Eurasia around the 4th Century B.C.E., possibly carried by the armies of Alexander the Great. By the 12th Century C.E., the disease was well-established – and widely feared in Europe – so much so that during the Third Lateran Council of 1179, the Catholic Church declared that sufferers must be banished – not only from regular society, from the realm of the living. Upon receiving a diagnosis, lepers were subjected to a bizarre ritual known as the “lepers’ mass”, wherein they were made to kneel in an open grave while a priest poured cemetery earth over their heads three times, symbolizing that they were now “Dead unto the world but alive unto Christ.” The priest then read off a long list of prohibitions, condemning the leper to a life of ostracism and isolation: “I forbid you to enter the church or monastery, fair, mill, market-place, or company of persons…ever to leave your house without your leper’s costume…to wash your hands or anything about you in the stream or fountain. I forbid you to enter a tavern…I forbid you, if you go on the road and you meet some person who speaks to you, to fail to put yourself downwind before you answer…I forbid you to go into a narrow lane so that if you should meet anyone he might catch the affliction from you…I forbid you ever to touch children or give them anything. I forbid you to eat or drink from any dishes but your own.

Earlier this month, C-Edge Technologies, the tech backbone of several banks, suffered a ransomware attack. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) was compelled to put out a notice that Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and other payment systems of banks serviced by C-Edge would be temporarily unavailable. Also read: India witnesses 15% rise in cyber attack cases in 2023; emerges as 2nd most targeted nationThis malware breach once again brought to light the fact that it’s no longer a question of if a cyber-attack will happen, but when.With cyber attacks increasing in both frequency and intensity, the demand for cybersecurity is on the rise and it is the chief executive officer (CEO), not chief information officer (CIO), on the hot seat, answering questions such as: Can you say for certain that we aren’t under cyber attack right now? If we are being hacked, how safe is our most valuable data? Is the organization prepared if our systems go down for an extended time? What is your best estimate of the impact on our finances, investors and customers? According to BCG estimates, cybercrime costs the global economy at least $2 trillion a year. India emerged as the second most targeted nation in APAC, with 2,138 weekly attacks per organization, trailing only behind Taiwan's 3,050 incidents in 2023, as per a CheckPoint report. The impact of cybercrime on Indian Financial Institutions is estimated at ₹1.67 trillion over two decades. Little wonder then that every CEO is expected to take direct responsibility for protecting the company against cybercrime and be accountable to regulators, the investing public, the board and other stakeholders. So, what just got added to the CEO’s vigilance perimeter? A broadening cyber battlefield: For years, the overwhelming majority of cybersecurity breaches have stemmed from organizational or human failure. This is still the case, but new tools are making phishing attacks—the oldest and most common hacking technique—easier, more effective, and less time-consuming to execute. Further, with generative AI, infiltrators can create more realistic deepfake content, as evidenced by a recent scam reported at a Hong Kong bank where an entire meeting was faked and $25.6 million was stolen. Also read: Unexpectedly, the cost of big cyber-attacks is fallingThreats to digital transformation: Companies that are going through a digital transformation are vulnerable. They have to manage two types of technologies—their legacy IT and solutions and those they are migrating to. These transitions create openings for hackers to exploit. Third-party vendor risk: Companies are increasingly becoming perimeter-free, expanding the number and type of third-party vendors they work with, and their supply chains are becoming more complex. Each additional link to a third party presents a potential window into a company’s network. Intensifying regulatory oversight: Regulators across the globe, especially in the US and Europe, are imposing a greater legal onus on CEOs to ensure that companies have robust cybersecurity risk-management procedures, controls and governance in place. Government watchdogs also insist that companies be more transparent about breaches and their consequences. It is a matter of time before Indian regulators also follow suit and even lead. Every CEO has to craft her own Cyber-Ready Playbook to stay ahead of the curve. Four key actionable areas: Quantify the risk: It is the job of the CEO to quantify every risk; cyber-risk is as real as any other financial risk. The CEO must mandate the chief revenue officer (CRO) to quantify, track and mitigate this risk. This should apply to digital transformation projects and third-party integration as well. Similarly, risk must be monitored with routine vigilance both on and off the system. For example, social media posts, customer service complaints, etc. Shore up the workforce: The critical lack of cybersecurity professionals is making companies vulnerable to online criminals. The World Economic Forum estimates a skill gap of 4 million people in cybersecurity. CEOs must train their lens on investing in the right talent and prevent internal employees from inadvertently creating cyber threats. Invest in technology resilience: A security breach happens when least expected. Hackers with ‘nuisance value’ have all the time and resources to prey upon vulnerable moments. The CEO, however, has to work on zero response time once an attack is confirmed. Investment in technology to systematically detect and monitor cyber intrusions and develop a playbook to build automated responses linked to a command centre is key. This ‘triaging and escalation’ system must advise appropriate responses, so that the system becomes self-healing.

Peace has so far remained elusive and rights groups criticize the government for not being able to bring the warring communities together.', 'content': 'Manipur has been torn by ethnic strife over the past year. Peace has so far remained elusive and rights groups criticize the government for not being able to bring the warring communities together. More than a year after deadly ethnic violence broke out between the majority Meitei community and the minority Kuki in India\\'s northeastern state of Manipur, tensions continue to rage. Peace has remained elusive and — according to many in the state — so has a concrete action from the government. The latest flare-up of violence occurred on September 1, after months of relative calm. According to authorities, several people have been killed in drone and rocket attacks. The use of such aerial weapons is a first for the restive state and the government called it a \"significant escalation\" of violence. The police in Manipur claim that Kuki groups carried out the drone attacks on Meitei-dominated areas. Kuki organizations, however, refute the allegations, saying that it was the Meiteis who used drones. Last year was the first time that the Meitei, who are predominantly Hindu, live mostly in and around the state\\'s capital city Imphal, and the Kuki — who are mainly Christian and inhabit the surrounding hills — clashed against each other. It came on the heels of a demand by the Meitei community to be officially accorded tribal status, which the Kukis protested. The conflict has since claimed the lives of 225 people, according to official data. More than 60,000 people remain displaced. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Activists have questioned the response of the authorities to quell the violence. Many have pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is yet to visit the state or make a comprehensive statement. \"There is a total abdication of the responsibility to protect the lives and the properties of the people in Manipur and that\\'s why the anger of Manipuris is going very deep,\" a Manipuri activist, who asked not to be named, told DW. Binalakshmi Nepram, a prominent human rights advocate focusing particularly on gender rights and female-led disarmament movements, calls it the \"darkest period\" in the history of Manipur. She says it is the prerogative of the state to ensure the security of the citizens. \"We have about 60,000-70,000 troops of the Indian security forces flown in just to ensure that the conflict is calmed down. The tragic part is that they have done nothing,\" she told DW. \"People of Manipur are absolutely flabbergasted. How come India, with its sophisticated weaponry, intelligence and technology, is not able to control the situation in a tiny part of the country? It has been going on for 16 months. This is what every Manipuri is asking,\" she added. Tellang Letminlen Haokip, a Kuki student leader from Churachandpur, said his community has been discriminated against for decades and that the ethnic tensions run deep. \"We have been economically and politically exploited. There is a huge mistrust between those living in the hills and those in the valley. There is hardly any development work in the hills. All good infrastructure is in the valley and we are denied sources of development and opportunities,\" he said. 40-year-old Surjit*, from the Meitei ethnic group, described the ethnic divisions as \"a ticking time bomb that has exploded.\" He noted that the Meiteis have been deprived of buying land in the hills, and that illegal migration of Kukis from Myanmar over the years has added to the strife. \"We want a scheduled tribe status, so that we can buy land in the hills, which currently we cannot,\" he said, referring to an official designation which would grant privileges and affirmative action benefits under India\\'s constitution. \"Then there is also the problem of illegal migration from Myanmar,\" he stressed, accusing the Kukis coming illegally from Myanmar of poppy cultivation and drug trafficking. \"After attempts from Imphal to destroy these plantations as part of a war on drugs, they [the Kukis] feel that they have been wronged by the Meiteis staying in the valley. But in my view, it\\'s not wrong to destroy something that could lead to people of the state falling prey to drugs,\" he said. Conflict is not new to Manipur, which became part of India in 1949. For decades, the state has been battered by cycles of violence between different ethnic communities warring against each other and a separatist insurgency. Experts say that successive governments have failed to address the root cause of the conflict in the state, which has historically been neglected by those who rule the power corridors in New Delhi. Nepram said that the lack of \"political maturity\" of those who are ruling over Manipur since the past 70 years shows a collective failure of successive governments. \"Once Manipur joined India, there should have been good policies in place to ensure coexistence. But rather there has been a militarization of that area. Rather than politica.'}, {'title': 'Demand for efficient airplanes remains: An interview with Darren Hulst', 'link': 'https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/aerospace-and-defense/our-insights/demand-for-efficient-airplanes-remains-an-interview-with-darren-hulst', 'date': '2024-09-13', 'short_description': 'McKinsey speaks to Darren Hulst, vice president of Boeing’s commercial marketing division, to discuss the latest industry trends and the outlook of aerospace 20 years into the future.', 'content': \"Throughout his 19-year career at Boeing, Darren Hulst has seen the aerospace sector change in many ways. As the vice president of Boeing’s commercial marketing division, Hulst keeps his finger on the pulse of the industry to see how consumer demand, technology, and global dynamics have evolved. Today, sustainability, affordability, and connectivity are top of mind for consumers and stakeholders alike. At the 2024 Farnborough International Airshow, McKinsey senior partner Vik Krishnan spoke to Hulst about the findings in Boeing’s latest Commercial Market Outlook, including trends in airline offerings across the globe, airplane design and use cases, and technology. An edited transcript of their conversation follows. Vik Krishnan: Tell us a bit about what you do at Boeing. Darren Hulst: I lead our commercial marketing team, which is global but mainly based in Seattle. Our team’s purview includes providing sales support and some technical support for our airline customers. On top of those responsibilities, we create the Commercial Market Outlook every year. We look at a lot of operational data, historical traffic data, and economic data to see where the market is headed, what the key drivers for the market are, trends that are changing the landscape today and in the future, and how these factors correlate to demand for air travel in the long term. Vik Krishnan: What changed between this year’s report and last year’s? Darren Hulst: Our outlook this year is up about 3 percent compared to last year, which is not unusual; the market usually grows by 3 percent every year. Our outlook for new airplanes needed in the marketplace in the next year is just under 44,000. In terms of big headline changes, there haven’t been a lot. The key areas we're focused on now are new airplane technologies that help lower emissions. First, the replacement cycle is accelerating, and we’re seeing pent-up demand for replacements in the near term. Capacity shortages and new deliveries today will also drive strong demand for replacements over the next ten years. Second, single-aisle aircraft make up the bulk of airplanes globally, but this year’s forecast anticipates increased production of wide-body aircraft because we’ve seen even more replacements in that part of the market, driven by the fact that relatively fewer of these airplanes have been delivered over the past five years. Vik Krishnan: Recently, we've been seeing narrow-body aircraft used increasingly on missions that historically were reserved for wide-body aircraft. They're flying not just transatlantic but also on increasingly longer missions on thinner routes. How do you see the dynamic of narrow-body and wide-body aircraft playing out? Darren Hulst: I think single-aisle aircraft with additional range capability will be filling niches and enabling airlines to fly in certain new city pairs. But I don't think it's a game-changing trend that will change how networks are structured in the future. The limited capacity on single-aisle airplanes for both passengers and cargo is prohibiting them from filling routes that wide-body aircraft can fill, so having more range doesn't necessarily open them to new network opportunities. But in certain cases, airlines that are more geographically advantaged might be able to do more connecting. Vik Krishnan: What are some examples? Darren Hulst: Most likely routes from the edge of Europe to the edge of North America and maybe something similar intra-America as well. Boeing 737 Max aircraft and 737 NG [Next Generation] aircraft have been doing flights like these for airlines such as Copa and Icelandair without the additional range capability that would be available on Airbus’s A321XLR. Less than a half percent of single-aisle airplane frequencies are used on routes of more than 3,000 miles. This trend is not measurably different than what we saw even 30 years ago when Boeing’s 757 was introduced, but in certain cases, it provides an opportunity. Vik Krishnan: Are the missions these aircraft are completing similar to what they were doing in the past? Darren Hulst: I would say so. Once you get above an eight-hour flight, wide-body airplanes offer a better cost to move cargo and operate and provide a premium product that sometimes single-aisle airplanes can't quite compete with. The key areas we're focused on now are new airplane technologies that help lower emissions. Vik Krishnan: Shifting gears a bit, at last year's Paris Air Show, there was a lot of talk about new technology, eVTOLs [electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft], hydrogen propulsion, and alternative combustion mechanisms to improve fuel efficiency and the sustainability footprint of airplanes. What's your view on these technologies? How do they factor into your current market outlook?

After Moscow\\'s all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the IMF stopped its annual consultations with Russia, which the Washington-based lender of last resort does for all its members. But on Sept 2, the IMF\\'s Russian executive director Aleksei Mozhin told Reuters the Fund would re-start online consultations on Sept. 16, and continue with an IMF delegation visit to Moscow for meetings with Russian officials until Oct. 1. \"We would like to express our strong dissatisfaction with such IMF plans,\" the finance ministers of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, Norway and Poland said in a letter to IMF head Kristalina Georgieva, seen by Reuters. Georgieva is attending a meeting of EU finance ministers and central bankers in Budapest and they will ask her about the IMF\\'s plans there, EU officials said. \"What recommendations does the IMF want to give Russia at the end of the consultation? How to better run a war economy?\" one senior euro zone official said. The letter said that as an aggressor country, Russia should not get the benefit of IMF advice and noted that if the IMF went through with its plans, it would diminish the willingness of donor countries to support Ukraine through IMF initiatives, because it would undermine trust in the IMF. \"Donors can choose other institutions like the World Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,\" the senior official said. The letter also said any data Russia would provide the IMF would be censored to show the country\\'s economy was allegedly doing well and resisting Western sanctions, making the IMF\\'s assessment inaccurate. Moscow would also use mission for its own propaganda purposes and it would damage the IMF\\'s reputation, it said. \"We thus call on the IMF not to resume cooperation with Russia and to remain committed to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter,\" the nine countries said. \"We urge all international financial institutions, including the IMF and its management, to continue refraining from the activities involving the aggressor state and not to resume dialogue as long as Russia continues its war of aggression against Ukraine,\" the letter said. The IMF said on Thursday its planned visit to Russia was in line with its regular obligations as well as those of Russia as a member country. The IMF\\'s last annual mission visited Russia in November 2019, before the start of the COVID pandemic. There have been no IMF missions to Russia since the start of Russia\\'s war in Ukraine. Many Western nations raised the possibility of Russia’s expulsion from the IMF in the aftermath of the Ukraine invasion, but that proved difficult because of reluctance from other members with large voting quotas such as China and India.

The country’s top legislative body approved a draft proposal to gradually implement the changes, state media reported Friday. China's retirement ages are among the lowest in the world and had remained unchanged since they were set in the 1950s. The statutory retirement age for both men and women will be gradually increased starting Jan. 1 of next year, according to the decision by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress. Over a period of 15 years, it will be raised from 60 to 63 for men, 55 to 58 for women in white-collar jobs and 50 to 55 for women working in factories. For those born in 1965, retirement would be delayed by one month, according to a chart published by Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency. Those born in 1984 would have to wait as long as five extra years to retire. The changes have been the subject of heated discussion among the Chinese public since they were proposed earlier this year. Young people already face intense competition to find jobs, while midcareer workers are being laid off as the Chinese economy recovers more slowly than expected after three years of pandemic isolation. “So after 60, we still have to squeeze onto the bus with the young folks?” read one comment on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform. “Asking for time off for your 60th birthday? And if you die at your desk, would it count as a workplace injury?” Another sardonic comment read, “I’m really worried that when I’m 70 and go for an interview, my resume will be dozens of pages long, and HR might question why there was a gap when I was 25. But because of dementia, I won’t even be able to remember it!” Raising the retirement age would ease pressure on the pension system at a time when local and provincial governments are facing massive budget deficits. Adding to the pressure is the fact that people are living longer in China, where life expectancy was 78 in 2021 compared with 51 in 1962, according to the World Bank. By 2035, the number of people 60 and older in China will exceed 450 million, or 32.7% of the total population, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. The workforce needed to support the retirement-age population is also shrinking, with the number of births falling 10% in 2022 to their lowest level on record. Last year, China fell to the world’s second-most-populous country after India. China’s decision to delay its retirement ages stems from a “really difficult” fiscal situation, said Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong. “Local governments simply don’t have the funds and pension payments are still decentralized,” she told NBC News. But it will take time for the impact to be felt, García-Herrero said. “China is starting late and from a very low level,” she said. “Even by 2040, the legal retirement age will still be low, comparatively, and still not gender-aligned.” On Weibo, commenters lamented the country’s economic and demographic predicament. “Young people can’t find jobs, and the elderly aren’t allowed to retire.” Jennifer Jett and Peter Guo reported from Hong Kong, and Rae Wang from Beijing.

India A, who made 290 in their first innings, earlier bowled out their opponents for 183 despite India batter Devdutt Padikkal's valiant 92 to gain a lead of 107 runs. Now, India A have an advantage of 222 runs, with Agarwal (56, 87b, 8x4) and Pratham (59 batting, 82b, 6x4) leading their run glut in the second innings. However, Agarwal, who is eager to chart his way back into selectorial reckoning, will be kicking himself for falling on the last ball of the day to part-time spinner Shreyas Iyer, spooning a simple return catch. But till that point, Agarwal and Pratham played fluently and executed some fluent drives and cuts as the run-rate never came under four. However, that's just one part of India A's story of domination on the day as earlier pacers Khaleel Ahmed and Aaqib Khan bagged three wickets apiece to rattle the India D line-up. Only one of their batters defied the constant challenge of judgement - Devdutt who stroked his way to a 124-ball 92 with 15 hits to the ropes. The Karnataka left-hander who made his Test debut earlier this year against England was particularly harsh on any offering on his pads or away from the off-stump. A century was there for his taking, but the 24-year-old fell just eight runs shy as his attempt to play a shot on the up off state-mate Prasidh Krishna ended up in a simple catch to stumper Kumar Kushagra. Advertisement The 11-4-30-1 figures do not fall under the hallow-spell category, but for Prasidh it was important in his comeback journey. This was the pacer's first outing in competitive cricket since Karnataka's Ranji Trophy game against Gujarat in January this year. Since that match, the 28-year-old was recuperating from a quadricep injury. Harshit Rana made a 31 off 29 balls, including two back-to-back sixes off left-arm spinner Shams Mulani, but his effort was not enough for India D to close the gap with their rivals. Advertisement However, Rana can take a slice of comfort as he completed a four-wicket haul in the opening session of the day to bowl out India A for 290 in their first dig. Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com India A were resuming from their overnight 288 for eight, but lost Mulani and Aaqib to Rana who ended up with 4 for 51.

Mastercard Inc. (MA, Financial) is currently the most attractive payment services investment if one is looking for stability, high growth, a robust moat and relatively low risk. I estimate that it is fairly valued when compared to Visa (V, Financial) and PayPal (PYPL, Financial) on future fundamental growth rates and current valuation multiples. In addition, I consider the company's emerging market position to be strong and, despite growing consolidation from regional payment providers in Asia posing a competitive threat, I am confident in management's strategy, brand cultivation and maintenance to continue to lead as one of the dominant payment companies in the world for the foreseeable future. Operational analysis I am incredibly bullish on Mastercard as a long-term investment for its low volatility. This is supported by its diversified revenue streams and moat in payment solutions, which are only surpassed by Visa. A significant driver of Mastercard's growth is its cross-border transactions at the moment, which are rising due to heightened international travel and e-commerce. In the second quarter, cross-border volumes grew by 17%, highlighting the importance of this segment. This is one of the core reasons why the company is currently expected to deliver stronger future growth than Visa because it is more strategically positioned with a focus on expansion in emerging markets right now. Mastercard's strategic investments in regions like Asia, the Middle East and Africa are a reason to be bullish, but Visa still holds a larger global market share despite being operational in fewer countries. Mastercard and Visa's cross-border volume and revenue growth. Mastercard is not only facing competition from Visa, but also from smaller credit and online payment providers, including American Express (AXP, Financial), Discover (DFS, Financial), PayPal, Stripe and others. American Express is particularly noteworthy because it targets high-income consumers and businesses, so I think Mastercard will be able to particularly benefit from focusing on emerging markets and affordable payment solutions; this is how I think management can structure Mastercard for continued higher growth rates than both Visa and American Express moving forward. The threat from PayPal and Stripe is more nuanced, but it does deserve attention, especially as novel payment solutions like cryptocurrency become more widespread and Web3 technologies begin to transform online payment solutions. In addition, we are seeing major payment networks in Asia, like UnionPay, JCB and RuPay, consolidate market share in local markets and also begin to expand internationally. UnionPay is the largest card issuer in the world by number of cards, with over 9 billion cards in circulation. While China is its core market, it is now accepted in 183 countries and regions. JCB, originally from Japan, is now accepted in over 190 countries and regions. Finally, RuPay, which is India's domestic card network, has rapidly grown its market share in India, surpassing Visa in terms of the number of transactions in the country. RuPay is accepted in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. The international markets are definitely competitive, but Mastercard has a strong position because it closely leads alongside Visa in brand recognition and trust, as well as in technological innovation. I consider reputation to be one of the hardest elements to develop in business and the strongest factor in long-term success once it has been cultivated. Mastercard's global brand provides it with power in emerging markets that may be unfamiliar with the less-renowned players. On the note of technological advancement, Mastercard has recently realigned its organizational structure to include a dedicated data and AI group. This is going to support the company in enhancing operational security, as well as improve the customer experience. In addition, management has decided to invest in technologies like contactless payments, tokenization and biometric authentication to enhance security and convenience for consumers. This is far ahead of other smaller payment companies, so I believe management can continue to consolidate its moat by aggressively investing in seamless payment technology to drive customer acquisition and retention. Financial analysis Currently, I consider Mastercard to be fairly valued, as although its price-earnings ratio without non-recurring items and its price-sales ratio is higher than that of Visa and PayPal, its future growth rates in earnings per share and sales support this. I believe the market has been efficient here with both Visa and Mastercard, with PayPal the obvious outlier, as its earnings growth is anticipated to be very strong moving forward, but it is clearly undervalued on both ratios.

This is Atlantic Intelligence, a newsletter in which our writers help you wrap your mind around artificial intelligence and a new machine age. Sign up here. Today, The Atlantic published a new investigation by contributing writer Karen Hao detailing Microsoft’s recent engagements with the oil and gas industries. Although the tech giant has spoken of the potential for AI to remake our world for the better and stave off climate change, behind the scenes, it has sought to market the technology to fossil-fuel companies to aid in drilling, among other applications. Karen spoke with 15 current and former Microsoft employees and read through hundreds of internal documents for her report. Fundamentally, this is a story about tension—between two points of view within Microsoft, and between the supposed promise of a technology and its actual uses in the here and now. Sustainability advocates within Microsoft have clashed with leadership over its pursuit of this business. And although Microsoft has maintained that AI could be used to make fossil-fuel companies more efficient, thereby making their work more sustainable, critics aren’t so sure. “The idea that AI’s climate benefits will outpace its environmental costs is largely speculative,” Karen writes, “especially given that generative-AI tools are themselves tremendously resource-hungry. Within the next six years, the data centers required to develop and run the kinds of next-generation AI models that Microsoft is investing in may use more power than all of India. They will be cooled by millions upon millions of gallons of water. All the while, scientists agree, the world will get warmer, its climate more extreme.” Microsoft’s Hypocrisy on AI By Karen Hao Microsoft executives have been thinking lately about the end of the world. In a white paper published late last year, Brad Smith, the company’s vice chair and president, and Melanie Nakagawa, its chief sustainability officer, described a “planetary crisis” that AI could help solve. Imagine an AI-assisted tool that helps reduce food waste, to name one example from the document, or some future technology that could “expedite decarbonization” by using AI to invent new designs for green tech. But as Microsoft attempts to buoy its reputation as an AI leader in climate innovation, the company is also selling its AI to fossil-fuel companies. Hundreds of pages of internal documents I’ve obtained, plus interviews I’ve conducted over the past year with 15 current and former employees and executives, show that the tech giant has sought to market the technology to companies such as ExxonMobil and Chevron as a powerful tool for finding and developing new oil and gas reserves and maximizing their production—all while publicly committing to dramatically reduce emissions.
