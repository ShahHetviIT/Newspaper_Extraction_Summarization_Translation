The spirit behind England's record-breaking day\", 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c93p72xk13do', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': \"England's record-breaking runscoring is testament to their incredible spirit, says chief cricket writer Stephan Shemilt\", 'content': 'Joe Root and Harry Brook became the first two England batters to record scores in excess of 250 in the same Test innings Two days ago, England had shipped 556, had an opener with a dislocated thumb and a stand-in captain out for a duck. They were feeling the heat, literally and figuratively, in the unbearable temperatures that have accompanied the first Test against Pakistan in Multan. Questions over preparation, Ben Stokes\\' hamstring and the lack of a reserve opener hung in the molten air. Why was there no fast bowler to cover for the injured Josh Hull and soon-to-be-married Olly Stone? Bowling consultant James Anderson had only just arrived from playing golf in Scotland. Forty-eight hours on, a record-breaking response has put England on the verge of their most remarkable Test victory since the last time they were in Pakistan. We\\'ll get to Harry Brook, Joe Root and the numbers, but it is worth reflecting on the final month of England\\'s summer, in order to give the beginning of their winter some context. The defeat in the final Test against Sri Lanka at The Oval led to accusations of disrespecting Test cricket, and Brook was among those in the dock. It got worse with Brook\\'s ham-fisted \"who cares?\" comment after the first one-dayer against Australia. Maybe it was the mood music around the England team that made coach Brendon McCullum tetchy the day before this first Test in Pakistan. He did not entertain questions about Anderson\\'s absence or the tightest-ever turnaround from a home summer to a winter tour. \"No excuses,\" was the message. McCullum is an optimist to his core. He has no time for British pessimism, falling back on a New Zealand \"she\\'ll be right\" mantra. Once a good enough rugby union fly-half to keep Dan Carter out of a schools team, he is also inspired by the All Blacks\\' \"no dickheads\" policy, external. He demands that his players buy in and give everything to the team. Full commitment is a non-negotiable. Not once in the build-up to the first Test, either in public or private, did an England player or member of staff say the heat would be an issue. \\'We didn\\'t know what the record was\\' - breaking down England\\'s brilliance Brook\\'s 317 leads record-breaking England towards victory Brook goes big as England close in on victory When the tourists were required to spend 149 overs in the field after losing the toss, their spirit was tested, but never close to breaking. Even after Ben Duckett mangled his thumb and Ollie Pope admirably stepped up to open, only to return to the dressing room two balls later, England were not cowed. What followed were two days of the most glorious England run-scoring this side of World War Two, producing numbers that only previously existed in grainy black-and-white footage and timeless Tests. Whichever way you cut it, the figures are mind-boggling, the sort that would have to be spelled out if they were on a vidiprinter – eight-hundred-and-twenty-three. At the centre of it all was Brook, now only the sixth member of one of English cricket’s most exclusive clubs. In passing 300, he became the first man to make a triple-century for England since BBC TV cut to horse racing for Graham Gooch’s landmark in his 333 against India at Lord\\'s in 1990. Brook would probably like England to play of all their Test cricket in Pakistan. In four Tests here he has more runs, 785, than his 761 in 13 matches in the UK. On this occasion, he credited an \"unreal\" pitch, and a surface ranked as the eighth-flattest across the first four days of a Test anywhere in the world since such data began being collected in 2007, adds perspective to England’s gluttony. Was Brook required to show the batsmanship of Gooch against West Indies at Headingley in 1991, Michael Atherton against South Africa in Johannesburg in 1995, or Kevin Pietersen’s dismantling of India in Mumbai in 2012? Almost certainly not, but this innings will be remembered for its sheer audacity, the dismantling of a bowling attack to reach 300 in 310 deliveries, the second-fastest triple of all time. For Brook, who admitted he was merely trying to beat his father David\\'s highest score of 210, it was also testament to a fitness regime implemented when he missed England\\'s tour of India earlier this year. Leaner, more agile in the field and with perhaps the safest pair of hands in the England team, Brook said he would have \"got to 150 and slogged one up in the air\" had he not got into such fine physical condition. If Brook was bouncing back from a rough end of the summer, he had a partner in Joe Root who knows all about having his mistakes put under the microscope. Root’s reverse-scoop at Jasprit Bumrah in the third Test in Rajkot in February was a moment of national crisis, but since then he is averaging in excess of 90. Root assured his place in English cricketing history by going past Sir Alastair Cook as the country’s all-time leading Test run-scorer on day three. In combining with Brook, he picked up another record, sharing 454 for the.'}, {'title': \"'My horrifying mountain rescue has not put me off'\", 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2mdyjgvm2o', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': 'Fay Manners says her next climb will be more relaxed after a recent trip sparked a rescue operation.', 'content': 'A British mountaineer said the \"horrifying\" experience of going missing in the Himalayas would not deter her from future expeditions. Fay Manners was found alongside her climbing partner, Michelle Dvorak, on Chaukhamba mountain, in northern India, on Sunday after an 80-hour rescue mission. The pair had been stranded at more than 20,000ft (6,096m) when the rope lifting their food, tent and climbing equipment snapped and plummeted. On her next trip, Ms Manners, who grew up in Bedfordshire, said: \"I think I\\'m just going to take a more relaxed climbing holiday.\" Both Ms Manners, 37, and Ms Dvorak, 31, from the United States, could only watch on as rescue helicopters failed to see them on two separate occasions. They later decided they had no choice but to make part of their descent alone, before being met by a search party. \"Although it was a really horrifying experience, mountaineering is my passion and it won’t deter me from continuing to do the sport,\" said Ms Manners, who now lives in Chamonix, France. However, the alpinist stressed having a rope snap on a loose rock was \"a really rare occurrence\". \"It\\'s usually really unlikely there would be such loose rock and rock form that would tangle your rope and split your tagline,\" Ms Manners said. \"I’ve been mountaineering for over 10 years on some really extreme routes, where I’ve been pioneering new lines, and it hasn’t happened to me before.\" Ms Manners was left almost hypothermic after she and Ms Dvorak took cover on a ledge for their first night while it snowed. After managing their daring abseil down the mountain face, they found some melting ice and were able to catch some water in their bottles. As they descended down a rock spur the following morning, they spotted a team of French climbers coming towards them. They shared their equipment, food and sleeping bags with the women and contacted the helicopter for rescue. \"We were really dehydrated and my body was just absolutely exhausted from trying to stay warm,\" Ms Manners said. The climber explained how she \"cried with relief\" after realising she could survive. Despite the ordeal, Ms Manners told the BBC she had already outlined her next trip, which will be a rock climbing expedition in Morocco. Before that, she planned to be \"eating lots of Cadbury\\'s chocolate\" as a reward for surviving her most recent challenge.

Not if Jake Sullivan can help it.', 'content': 'Jake Sullivan was standing in the middle of his office, which occupies an airy, sunlit corner of the West Wing, looking like he didn’t quite know what to do with his hands. He was taking me on a perfunctory three-minute tour of the space, even though the office tour is, perhaps, the most tired trope of the magazine profile—and, I’d been warned, Sullivan is not a fan of magazine profiles. At least, not the ones that are about him. The White House national security adviser is a most serious person and, by most accounts, always has been—a Minnesota kid who had memorized world capitals before the age of 14 and, by 35, had traveled to 112 of those countries as then secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s close adviser. A former Rhodes Scholar and world-class debater, he deftly swats away questions he dislikes by challenging their premise and speaks in polished paragraphs, not unlike his old boss, President Barack Obama. One White House official I spoke to described Sullivan as having a “relentless mind.” The pageantry of the magazine profile—the part where reporters read too much into whatever the subject is drinking or wearing, which in Sullivan’s case is almost always a slightly oversize black suit with a limited rotation of solid, wide ties—can seem a little fluffy for someone who has so carefully cultivated a reputation for depth and substance. So as he walked me around the room that afternoon in May, gamely humoring me in a bit of high-speed show-and-tell, even I cringed a bit. The next day, he was headed to Saudi Arabia to discuss a pathway to Middle East peace with the Crown Prince, but had I seen the photo of the old shed behind the house where he grew up? In defense of this particular office tour, I was there not for color but to scope out one specific item I’d heard about before coming to meet Sullivan. Tucked up on a corner bookshelf, there it was: a small patch of white fabric embroidered with three red arrows in the center, encased in a simple square frame. It was a gift Sullivan had made for his counterparts from Japan and the Netherlands in preparation for a high-stakes, hush-hush meeting in Washington last January. The arrows were a nod to an old Japanese parable, in which a father teaches his three sons a lesson by handing each of them an arrow and instructing them to break it. One by one, the arrows snap. Next, he ties three new arrows together and tells them to try again. Bound together, the arrows hold firm. Strength, the story teaches, comes from unity. Sullivan trusted his guests to grasp the message as they met to orchestrate their own quiet show of solidarity: a plan to keep the world’s most advanced semiconductors and the machines that make them out of China’s hands. The meeting was part of a tectonic shift for America’s China policy that began under the Trump administration. But it was also a shift for Sullivan, who had once subscribed to the mainstream belief that free trade with China was the way to seed peace and prosperity in the world. He had since been disabused of that notion. Under President Xi Jinping, China had used advanced chips from the US to power supercomputers that surveilled Muslim minorities and trained AI systems that could enhance its military capabilities. At the same time, the Chinese armed forces had conspicuously expanded its military drills off the coast of Taiwan, which produces most of the world’s advanced semiconductors. If China were to invade the island, as US intelligence predicted it could be ready to do by 2027, it could create a catastrophic chip shortage, impacting everything from smartphones to medical devices to weaponry. The Chinese government had made no secret of its interest in replacing the US as a technological superpower. Preventing that scenario had become one of Sullivan’s top priorities. He couldn’t do it alone. While American firms such as Nvidia design the most powerful chips in the world, those chips—called graphics processing units—are made on the back of a vast and interconnected global supply chain. Much of the equipment in Taiwanese semiconductor factories comes from the Netherlands, Japan, and the United States. The US had already begun blocking its most advanced chips from being exported to China. But like the proverbial lone arrow, those controls would all break down if China could still buy the machinery to make chips elsewhere. “Government’s hard,” Sullivan says about how the job has changed him. “So you just become hard.” Over the course of several hours, sitting inside a meeting room at Blair House, the two-century-old DC townhome where foreign dignitaries stay on official business, the three men ironed out the precise contours of each country’s controls, finalizing what would be included and how long they would have to act. By the time they left, they had a firm understanding in place—and Sullivan’s gift, as a reminder of the costs of backing out. None of the officials involved in the meeting have ever spoken publicly about thei.'}, {'title': 'Which teams can qualify for the Women’s T20 World Cup semifinals and how?', 'link': 'https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/10/10/which-teams-can-qualify-for-the-womens-t20-world-cup-semifinals-and-how', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': 'What do India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the other teams need to do in order to seal a spot?

New Delhi, India – When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was inaugurating a controversial Hindu temple in the northern city of Ayodhya on January 22 this year, J*, a student living hundreds of miles away in the southern state of Kerala was about to post his take on the event on Instagram. “Remains of Indian Constitution Beneath Ram Mandir: ASI Survey,” the 21-year-old student of humanities posted on his handle, The Savala Vada, criticising the Hindu nationalist leader for allegedly undermining India’s secular constitution by leading a religious ceremony at a temple built on the ruins of a 16th-century mosque. Since India’s independence in 1947, dozens of Hindu groups, led by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the far-right ideological mentor of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), claimed the Mughal-era Babri Mosque stood at the exact site where Ram, among Hinduism’s most prominent deities, was born. A Hindu mob demolished the mosque in 1992, triggering deadly riots that killed more than 2,000 people and fundamentally altered the course of India’s politics. After the demolition, the state-run Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) backed the Hindu groups’ claim as the dispute went to the country’s top court, which in 2019 gave the site to a government-backed trust to build a Ram temple. Muslims were given another piece of land in Ayodhya, several kilometres away from the temple, to build a mosque. A year later, Modi laid the foundation stone for the grand temple and opened it in January this year to kick-start his re-election for a record third term. As soon as J made the Instagram post, it went viral. It invited backlash from right-wing Hindu trolls. But it also helped The Savala Vada to grow exponentially. J and his two teammates working with him on the handle prefer to remain anonymous over fears they “could get attacked or killed”, as they put it. “There is an entire ecosystem in place that is targeting people who dissent,” J said. “It’s also about protecting oneself when you are speaking in an online space against the ruling establishment and power. Anonymity gives me that protection.” Al Jazeera sought comments from multiple BJP spokespersons on J’s allegations, but did not receive a response. Inspired by The Onion, the United States digital media company that publishes satirical articles on local and international news, The Savala Vada was launched by J on July 21, 2023. “Savala” in Malayalam language means onion, and “vada” is a popular South Indian snack. J said his venture is also a “homage” to the kind of work The Onion does. “The idea came out of a need to create a space where we could discuss and put out contemporary sociopolitical events with a humorous and satirical spin,” he told Al Jazeera. “It was also about envisioning a democratic, secular and pluralistic space where we report the truth by using tropes of comedy and satire.” The Instagram handle, said J, started with posts about cultural or historical events but slowly began to focus on news and current affairs to channel what he called his disillusionment with the mainstream Indian media, which many critics have accused of amplifying the BJP’s hate politics against minority Muslims and Christians, as well as being subservient to Modi. “I belong to a minority religious community and it is extremely difficult to voice your dissent in the current polarised times,” J said, adding that his focus was to “combine humour and resistance” while also reaching out to Gen Z and millennials through his satire. Apart from The Onion, J said he was also inspired by American comedian George Carlin, British stand-up John Oliver, and Australia’s The Juice Media, which posts satirical takes targeting the government. Over the past year, The Savala Vada has made more than 680 Instagram posts and gained close to 69,000 followers. Last month, it saw 7.8 million views on its posts and stories. The handle responds to major national and global events, its precise and direct headlines condensed in a manner that challenges the established narrative through humour and satire. For example, when Israeli air strikes denied targeting hospitals in Gaza during the continuing genocide, The Savala Vada wrote: “Israeli Defence Forces Claim Gaza Armed With Self-Exploding Hospitals”. When several Indian journalists flew to Israel to cover the Israel-Palestine conflict, the handle posted: “Air India Flights To Israel Cheaper Than To Manipur for Indian Journos” – a take on the same journalists or their organisations refusing to report on ethnic riots in India’s northeast that have been going on for more than a year. To mock the state of journalism in India, they once wrote: “Mainstream Indian Journalism Committed To Sacred Duty Of Endangering Lives of Muslims.” Some of their posts responded to the situation in the disputed ter.'}, {'title': 'Etihad to bring back more of its posh Airbus A380s, says new US city coming', 'link': 'https://thepointsguy.com/news/etihad-airbus-a380-us-expansion-plans/', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': 'The Airbus A380 continues to find a new lease on life with Etihad Airways planning to bring back two more of the superjumbo jets as part of its strong post-coronavirus recovery.

Etihad\\'s sixth and seventh A380s will return to its fleet in February and June of 2025, respectively, said Arik De, the airline\\'s chief revenue officer, at the Routes World conference in Bahrain on Oct. 7. The planes will be used on flights to Singapore and a yet-to-be-named destination on the airline\\'s map. The carrier first resumed A380 operations on flights to London\\'s Heathrow Airport (LHR) last year from its base at Abu Dhabi\\'s Zayed International Airport (AUH). Etihad has since expanded use of the superjumbos to flights to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (BOM) in Mumbai, India; New York\\'s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK); and Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG). The A380\\'s new lease on life comes after many wrote off the 400-plus-seat plane early in the pandemic. Former Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker famously panned the plane as being a \"mistake\" early in the crisis. But as passengers surged back to air travel and Airbus and Boeing struggled to deliver new planes, many airlines reactivated their A380s to meet demand. \"The Airbus A380 we never thought we\\'d bring back, and [soon we will] have seven of them flying,\" De said. Lufthansa and Qatar Airways are two other airlines that \"retired\" their A380s only to later bring them back. Etihad\\'s A380s are known for their posh Residence product, essentially a three-room private cabin at the front of the first-class section on the upper deck. It is one of the most exclusive products on a commercial aircraft today. Value check: Are airline credit cards worth it anymore? The Residence is staying even as Etihad undertakes a $750 million refurbishment of the cabins on its A380s and Boeing 787s, De said. The A380 updates will focus on \"soft furnishings\" and a potential expansion of the 70-seat business-class cabin, he added. The majority of the investment will go to the airline\\'s 43 Boeing 787s and 14 Boeing 777s. \"You\\'re going to hear at least one new U.S. destination very, very soon,\" De said on the airline\\'s growth plans. When asked if it could be one of the three cities Etihad has not returned to since its 2017 restructuring — Dallas-Fort Worth, Los Angeles and San Francisco — De declined to comment except to say that the destination was \"not a usual suspect.\" The airline serves Boston Logan International Airport (BOS), where flights began in March, plus Chicago\\'s O\\'Hare International Airport (ORD), New York\\'s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Dulles International Airport (IAD) near Washington, D.C., from Abu Dhabi. Etihad counts JetBlue, with its large Boston and New York hubs, among its global network of partner airlines. Superjumbo: Etihad\\'s flagship Airbus A380 — and the exclusive Residence — is officially back in the US The carrier plans to increase seats to the U.S. by about 24% this year compared to 2013, Cirium Diio schedule data shows. Despite the growth, Etihad will fly about 30% fewer seats to the U.S. this year than it did at its peak in 2017, the Cirium Diio data shows. The airline cut flights to the U.S. and elsewhere as part of its restructuring following years of cash-fueled growth and questionable equity investments in smaller airlines in various corners of the globe. Etihad\\'s flights to the U.S benefit from the only Department of Homeland Security preclearance facility — where travelers clear customs before they board their flight to the U.S. — outside of Canada, the Caribbean and Europe. That allows its flights to arrive as domestic flights at American airports and speeds up the arrival process for travelers.

Degree in Architecture from Cornell University in 1962, Ratan Tata joined the family firm and a decade later succeeded his uncle, the legendary JRD Tata, as chairman of the Tata Group. And as condolence messages pour in from influential figures, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Ratan Tata’s career offers invaluable lessons in leadership, innovation, and global expansion. He was a catalyst for change, championing ethical business practices and emphasizing social responsibility through initiatives like Tata Trusts. His leadership at Tata Motors and Tata Steel exemplified his commitment to rural development and nation-building. But more than that, Ratan Tata was a master marketer obsessed with branding, leaving an indelible mark on both the corporate landscape and Indian society.

Similarly, brand managers could better ensure their campaigns reflect transparency and authenticity. And it makes sense given research indicates that younger generations anchor their consumption in ethical considerations. Gen Z demands that brands stand for something meaningful and expects consistency in ethics across suppliers and partners. Notably, 46% of consumers aged 15-39 reduced their fast-fashion consumption in the past year, while 40% avoided products with excessive packaging. Additionally, 24% shunned companies due to allegations of sexism or racism, and 23% steered clear of brands with concerning environmental footprints. Embrace Change Secondly, Ratan Tata’s leadership within the Tata Group exemplified the need to adapt and evolve. He wasn’t afraid to embrace change. And yet it’s baffling to me how so many marketing leaders remain behind the curve on embracing new technologies. Consider luxury retail, some brands still remain trapped in outdated practices and have yet to fully embrace digital transformation. Recent data reveals that 68% of luxury shoppers believe digital tools like augmented reality (AR) can enhance their shopping experience. Furthermore, 64% use social platforms to inform their purchase decisions, and 69% expect luxury brands to integrate AR into their offerings. This shift underscores the necessity for brands to engage with the next generation through innovative digital experiences.

Here’s how it works. Christopher Charles Benninger, the influential architect, urbanist, and educator, passed away at 82 on 2 October 2024, in Pune, India. Born in Ohio, Benninger lived most of his life in India, which he regarded as his homeland, immersing himself in the country’s dynamic journey towards modernity. Drawn by India’s vibrant tapestry of culture and its myriad post-colonial challenges, he engaged deeply with the nation’s aspirations. He embraced the belief that 'architecture is the art of creating space for the human spirit'. For him, architecture transcended mere design; it served as a catalyst for social change, reflecting the hopes and narratives of the communities it served. Christopher Charles Benninger TBMSG Nagaloka After leaving a tenure position at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Benninger co-founded the School of Planning at what is now CEPT University in Ahmedabad in 1971, alongside BV Doshi (Doshi also passed, in 2023). Education was central to his life. He established many important educational institutes and campuses, designed programmes and curricula, and taught and wrote extensively in both formal and informal capacities. His studio at India House in Pune became a vibrant nexus of creativity, now led by Ramprasad Akkisetti (Ram), his loving life partner, who continues to further his legacy. 'The best architecture is born from the dialogues we have with the world around us.' This philosophy underpinned Benninger’s work, inspiring future generations to engage meaningfully with their environments. TBMSG Nagaloka In a rapidly evolving India, he designed extensive low-income housing projects for urban development authorities and state governments between 1972 and 1986, established the Centre for Development Studies and Activities in Pune in 1976, and prepared development plans for cities in Sri Lanka (1979–83), India (1971–96), and Bhutan (1979–86). His focus on community needs and poverty alleviation informed his notable projects, including the Mahindra United World College in Nanegaon, the Alliance Française in Gujarat, the Baja Science Centre, the Kochi Refinery Headquarters, Azim Premji University, and the SOS Children’s Village in Bhawana, Delhi. Additionally, he constructed the United Nations House in Bhutan and contributed to the Thimphu Capital Plan and National Ceremonial Plaza. Mahindra United World College (MUWC) Viewing cities as living entities, Benninger intertwined the narratives of people, buildings, and landscapes. He championed participatory planning, inviting communities into the design process to address urban challenges. His commitment to sustainability and culturally resonant design made him a pivotal figure in the discourse on equitable urban development.

Conversations with Benninger were expansive, exploring the diverse nature of India and the interplay of people and ideas. His life was a dialogue with emerging architects, revealing design philosophies rooted in authenticity and 'honest expression'. Fluent in local materials and cultural narratives, he practised 'critical regionalism', creating spaces that resonated deeply with their surroundings. Alliance Francaise He collaborated with and learned from luminaries such as José Luis Sert, Walter Gropius, Jerry Soltan, Fumihiko Maki, Kevin Lynch, Herbert Gans, Edmund Bacon, Margaret Mead, and Buckminster Fuller. He taught studios with Jane Drew and Roger Montgomery, studied economics under John Kenneth Galbraith, and became Barbara Ward’s protégé. As he often remarked, 'Be, not seem', a philosophy that invites deeper engagement with the world. Benninger’s spirit, rich in critical thought and creative solutions, will continue to inspire architects and thinkers globally, reminding us of the profound impact design can have on society.

Since last month, foreign-based companies no longer require approval from the backlogged National Company Law Tribunal for a so-called \"reverse flip\" merger with a domestic subsidiary, effectively reducing the time the process takes to about three to four months from at least 12 to 18 months previously. Many of the dozens of Indian startups that once chose to be based abroad for better access to capital and smaller tax bills are now queuing to return home from financial hubs such as the U.S. and Singapore due to better initial public offering prospects in a country that does not allow dual listings. While Razorpay, Pine Labs and KreditBee are in advanced stages of completing the reverse flip, Zepto, Eruditus and InMobi are also trying to finish the merger process in the coming months in preparation for eventual IPOs, multiple sources said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly. \"India is a home market and a place where everybody knows and understands us. From a listing perspective, it makes sense to be in India,\" said Harshil Mathur, the co-founder and CEO of Razorpay. The U.S.-domiciled online payments firm was valued at $7.5 billion as of its last fundraising in December 2021 and is looking to shift to India. IPOs in India including by startups Ola Electric and FirstCry have raised $9.17 billion in the first nine months of this year, up from $4.68 billion in the same period last year, according to LSEG data, making the country a rare bright spot for equity capital raising by companies in the Asia-Pacific region. \"With the IPO market thriving, a reverse flip makes sense. Moreover, the streamlined merger process, designed to facilitate swift and efficient scheme approvals without court intervention, further supports this strategic move,\" said Mehul Shah, a partner at corporate law firm Khaitan & Co. Before the rule change, only a handful of companies such as Walmart-backed digital payments firm PhonePe and online investment platform Groww had engineered a reverse flip. Those processes concluded in October 2022 and March 2024 respectively, though the timing of their India IPO plans remains unclear. PhonePe had to pay about $1 billion in capital gains taxes to the Indian government to complete the reverse flip, something that its co-founder and CEO Sameer Nigam once termed as a \"very stiff shock\". Groww took \"several years to finish the process\", an executive said on condition of anonymity. The startups did not respond to requests seeking comment. \"Even without this regulation, last we saw eight to 10 new-age companies were on the path to reverse flip. So, this will encourage (even more of them to follow suit),\" Gaurav Sood, head of equity capital markets at investment bank Avendus, said of the rule change. IN INDIA WE TRUST The homecoming of the IPO-bound startups is understandable given India\\'s requirement that only local companies list on its exchanges and its ban on dual listings, along with a thin track record of such companies listing overseas. Moreover, India\\'s central bank and other regulators prefer local firms over their foreign counterparts for key operational licenses such as those required by fintechs, according to industry sources. Stricter government scrutiny of foreign inflows and business deals have also raised compliance risks for startups, the sources said. The Reserve Bank of India and India\\'s market regulator did not respond to requests seeking comment. An IPO in India also offers startup investors a potentially more lucrative exit avenue. \"There is a strong appetite for tech stocks among Indian public investors, retail investors included,\" said Sandeep Patil, partner, and Asia head at venture capital firm QED Investors. But while India has eased reverse flipping norms, it is unlikely to unveil related capital gains tax concessions. India\\'s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told the Economic Times in March the Indian startups shifting back home would have to pay taxes. \"Why they want to come back is not an altruistic motive. They want to list in India because here\\'s where you get the valuations,\" Goyal said. His office did not respond to Reuters\\' requests for fresh comment.

(Getty Images: Hagen Hopkins) Australia could be without Cameron Green for the much-anticipated Test series against India, as he considers surgery on his back. The first round of the Sheffield Shield season began this week, with several hopefuls pushing their case for selection to the Australia team. There are another three Sheffield Shield matches and two Australia A Games scheduled before the first Test begins on November 22. Star all-rounder Cameron Green is considering back surgery that would see him miss Australia's five-Test series against India this summer. If Green does decide to have surgery, Australia's selectors would have to find a new batter to slot into the Test top six as they ponder a possible rejig to the batting line-up. A formal announcement on Green's decision is expected on Friday or Saturday. The eagerly anticipated series against India begins in late November with the five Tests played crammed into six weeks. Green had originally hoped to play in the first or second test purely as a batter, but a decision to go under the knife would rule him out for months. The alternative to surgery was a rehabilitation program that may have allowed Green to play earlier this summer, but that ran the risk of a recurrence of the injury. Cameron Green's absence would present a major problem for Australia as it tries to lock down an unsettled batting order. (Getty Images: Albert Perez/Cricket Australia) Green, who has a history of stress fractures, complained of back pain during Australia's one-day tour of England in September and was immediately sent home. The 25-year-old has emerged as a crucial member of Australia's Test side, cementing himself as the number four batter with a magnificent 174 not out against New Zealand in Wellington earlier this year. He now has a batting average of 48.57 in his 28 tests to go with his 35 wickets. While Australia's T20 captain Mitch Marsh can expect to pick up some of the slack in Australia's bowling attack, the absence of Green will cause a reshuffle in the batting line-up. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. The biggest headache is at the top of the order where Steve Smith has underwhelmed since taking over as opener after David Warner retired. Including his 91 not out against the West Indies, Smith has scored just 171 runs in four matches as an opener at an average of 28.5. There is speculation Smith will return to number four in the batting line-up. That would open a hole at the top which could be filled by a specialist opener or a rejig of the order, which could see the likes of Travis Head or Mitch Marsh opening alongside Usman Khawaja. However, neither Head nor Marsh opened in the first round of Sheffield Shield matches currently being played. Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast. The prospect of a new batter at the top of the order reopens a debate that raged at the beginning of last summer as David Warner completed his farewell tour in the three-Test series against Pakistan. Smith's eagerness to move up the order allowed the selectors to bring Cam Green back into the side at number four. But with Green now out and Smith likely to move back down, the same names that were debated last summer are once again auditioning. Victoria's Marcus Harris pushed his case to add to his 14 tests scoring a pacy 143 in the side's first innings of the Shield match against Tasmania being played at Melbourne's Junction Oval. Two other former test players, Western Australia's Cameron Bancroft (0) and Queensland's Matthew Renshaw (6) both failed in the first innings of the current match between the two states in Perth. The 'smokey' could be 19-year-old NSW wunderkind, Sam Konstas. Konstas scored a brilliant 152 against South Australia in Sydney and followed it up with another century in the second innings in just his fourth Sheffield Shield match. With chair of selectors George Bailey watching on, Konstas could not have picked a better time to score a century in each innings, adding to the 100 he scored against the West Indies at the Under-19 World Cup earlier this year. If Konstas can keep this up, his case may be too compelling to overlook despite his tender years. As it is, Konstas, Harris, Bancroft and Renshaw have more chances to push their cases. There are another three Sheffield Shield matches and two Australia A Games scheduled before the first test begins on November 22. Green's absence would also be a concern for Australia's bowling attack against India's strong batting line-up. He could be counted on for handy overs to spell Australia's trio of dynamic quicks: Pat Cummins, Josh Hazelwood and Mitchell Starc.

The story is told from the perspective of marine biologist Professor Pierre Aronnax, who joins the expedition at the last minute only to be shipwrecked by the monster and saved by the Nautilus.

This is an origin story for Captain Nemo, in which he is robbed of his birthright and forced to help build an experimental submarine – a submarine he then steals in order to enact his revenge. It\\'s a \"reimagining\" of the original, and this time the big monster appears to be the East India Company.

His ability to take bold, audacious business risks informed a high-profile acquisition strategy that kept the salt-to-steel conglomerate founded 155 years ago by his forefathers relevant after India liberalised its economy in the 1990s. At the turn of the millennium, Tata executed the biggest cross-border acquisition in Indian corporate history - buying Tetley Tea, the world’s second largest producer of teabags. The iconic British brand was three times the size of the small Tata group company that had bought it. In subsequent years, his ambitions grew only bigger, as his group swallowed up major British industrial giants like the steelmaker Corus and the luxury car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover. While the acquisitions didn’t always pay off - Corus was bought at very expensive valuations just before the global financial crisis of 2007, and remained a drag on Tata Steel’s performance for years - they were big power moves. They also had a great symbolic effect, says Mircea Raianu, historian and author of Tata: The Global Corporation That Built Indian Capitalism. He adds that they “represented \\'the empire striking back\\' as a business from a former colony took over the motherland\\'s prize assets, reversing the sneering attitude with which British industrialists looked upon the Tata Group a century earlier”. The Tata Group’s outlook had been “outward-oriented” from the very beginning, according to Andrea Goldstein, an economist who published a study in 2008 on the internationalisation of Indian companies, with a particular focus on Tata. As early as in the 1950s, Tata companies operated with foreign partners. But Ratan Tata was keen to “internationalise in giant strides, not in token, incremental steps”, Ms Goldstein pointed out. His unconventional education in architecture and a ring side view of his family group companies may have played a part in the way he thought about expansion, says Mr Raianu. But it was the “structural transformation of the group” he steered, that allowed him to execute his vision for a global footprint. Tata had to fight an exceptional corporate battle at Bombay House, the group headquarters, when he took over as the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991 - an appointment that coincided with India’s decision to open up its economy. He began centralising increasingly decentralised, domestic-focused operations by showing the door to a string of \\'satraps\\' (a Persian term meaning an imperial governor) at Tata Steel, Tata Motors and the Taj Group of Hotels who ran operations with little corporate oversight from the holding company. Doing this allowed him not only to surround himself with people who could help him execute his global vision, but also prevent the Tata Group - protected thus far from foreign competition - from fading into irrelevance as India opened up. At both Tata Sons, the holding company, as well as individual groups within it, he appointed foreigners, non-resident Indians and executives with contacts and networks across the world in the management team. He also set up the Group Corporate Centre (GCC) to provide strategic direction to group companies. It provided “M&A [mergers and acquisitions] advisory support, helped the group companies to mobilise capital and assessed whether the target company would fit into the Tata\\'s values”, researchers at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore wrote in a 2016 paper. The GCC also helped Tata Motors raise money for high-profile buyouts like Jaguar Land Rover which dramatically changed the global perception of a company that was essentially a tractor manufacturer. “The JLR takeover was widely seen as \\'revenge\\' on Ford, which had derisively refused to acquire Tata Motors in the early 90s and then was beaten to the punch on the deal by Tata Motors. Taken together, these acquisitions suggested that Indian corporates had \\'arrived\\' on the global stage just as growth rates were picking up and the liberalising reforms bearing fruit,” says Mr Raianu. Today, the $128bn group operates across 100 countries with a substantial portion of its total revenues coming from outside India. While the Tata Group made significant strides overseas in the early 2000s, domestically the failure of the Tata Nano – launched and marketed as the world’s cheapest car – was a setback for Tata. This was his most ambitious project, but he had clearly misread India’s consumer market this time. Brand experts say an aspirational India didn’t want to associate with the cheap car tag. And Tata himself eventually admitted that the \"poor man\\'s car\" tag was a \"stigma\" that needed to be undone. He believed there could be a resurrection of his product, but the Tata Nano was eventually discontinued after sales plummeted year on year. Succession at the Tata Group also became a thorny issue.

This activity encompassed debugging malware, writing articles for websites, generating biographies for social media accounts, and creating AI-generated profile pictures for fake accounts on X. \"Threat actors continue to evolve and experiment with our models, but we have not seen evidence of this leading to meaningful breakthroughs in their ability to create substantially new malware or build viral audiences,\" the artificial intelligence (AI) company said. It also said it disrupted activity that generated social media content related to elections in the U.S., Rwanda, and to a lesser extent India and the European Union, and that none of these networks attracted viral engagement or sustained audiences. This included efforts undertaken by an Israeli commercial company named STOIC (also dubbed Zero Zeno) that generated social media comments about Indian elections, as previously disclosed by Meta and OpenAI earlier this May. Some of the cyber operations highlighted by OpenAI are as follows - Elsewhere, the company said it took steps to block several clusters of accounts, including two related to influence operations codenamed A2Z and Stop News, that generated English- and French-language content for subsequent posting on a number of websites and social media accounts across various platforms. \"[Stop News] was unusually prolific in its use of imagery,\" researchers Ben Nimmo and Michael Flossman said. \"Many of its web articles and tweets were accompanied by images generated using DALL·E. These images were often in cartoon style, and used bright color palettes or dramatic tones to attract attention.\" Two other networks identified by OpenAI Bet Bot and Corrupt Comment have been found to use OpenAI\\'s API to generate conversations with users on X and send them links to gambling sites, as well as manufacture comments that were then posted on X, respectively. The disclosure comes nearly two months after OpenAI banned a set of accounts linked to an Iranian covert influence operation called Storm-2035 that leveraged ChatGPT to generate content that, among other things, focused on the upcoming U.S. presidential election. \"Threat actors most often used our models to perform tasks in a specific, intermediate phase of activity — after they had acquired basic tools such as internet access, email addresses and social media accounts, but before they deployed \\'finished\\' products such as social media posts or malware across the internet via a range of distribution channels,\" Nimmo and Flossman wrote. The misuse of generative AI for fraud and deepfake operations notwithstanding, cybersecurity company Sophos, in a report published last week, said the technology could also be abused to disseminate tailored misinformation by means of microtargeted emails. This entails abusing AI models to concoct political campaign websites, AI-generated personas across the political spectrum, and email messages that specifically target them based on the campaign points, thereby allowing for a new level of automation that makes it possible to spread misinformation at scale. \"This means a user could generate anything from benign campaign material to intentional misinformation and malicious threats with minor reconfiguration,\" researchers Ben Gelman and Adarsh Kyadige said. \"It is possible to associate any real political movement or candidate with supporting any policy, even if they don\\'t agree. Intentional misinformation like this can make people align with a candidate they don\\'t support or disagree with one they thought they liked.\".'}, {'title': 'Behind the Hotel Deals in Bengaluru – India Report', 'link': 'http://skift.com/2024/10/09/behind-the-hotel-deals-in-bengaluru-india-report/', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': \"Two back-to-back hotel deals in Bengaluru point towards a high investor interest.

The loan is meant to acquire a 220-key hotel asset situated near the Bengaluru airport from Twenty Fourteen Hotels. The property, spread across 6.5 acres of land, is designed to be a five-star hotel. The Driving Factors: JLL India managing director for hotels and hospitality group Jaideep Dang told Skift that the acquisition comes on the back of increasing demand for office spaces. A lot of companies are placed in Bengaluru and are further populating the city. Because of that, there is a growing demand for hotel rooms, he said. “The main reason driving the hotel sector in Bengaluru is the business demand. It maintained the number one position in the July to September quarter in terms of office leasing activity. These leases are generally for 9 years, indicating that more people are going to work in this city for the next 9 years. This is a clear indicator that as a business city, Bengaluru has strong demand,” he said. Bengaluru also has a strong market for food and beverages, as well as events. This adds to hotel industry’s revenue sources. The addition of new flights to Bengaluru is also a factor, he said. “The important thing to understand is that both of these transactions took place at a high valuation, and were not distress sales. The players genuinely believe that there is a potential and demand for high return on investment.” Investor Interest in Indian Hotels: Hotel transactions in India are expected to amount to a total of $413 million by the end of the year, according to estimates of JLL. It expects Tier-1 markets to dominate hotel transaction activity in the second half of 2024, accounting for 78% of the expected transaction volume. The surge in investor interest is driven by favorable macroeconomic factors, expanding commercial markets, and improved air connectivity, said Dang. The domestic air passenger traffic in September 2024 is estimated at 13.2 million, up by 15.2% as compared to pre-Covid levels, according to credit ratings agency ICRA. This figure was also 8% higher than the domestic traffic in September last year. Airlines’ capacity deployment during the month was 7.3% higher year-on-year, but was marginally lower than August 2024. Between April and September, the first six months of the 2024-25 financial year, the domestic air passenger traffic is estimated to be nearly 80 million, up 13% from pre-Covid levels. According to ICRA’s estimates, in the first 5 months of the 2025 fiscal, Indian airlines carried about 13.6 million international passengers. This was 15.7% more than last year, and 47.4% higher than the pre-Covid figures, it said. The firm maintained a stable outlook for the Indian aviation industry, backed by expectations of moderate growth in domestic air passenger traffic and a relatively stable cost environment. Meanwhile, India’s civil aviation minister Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu said that India’s domestic air passenger traffic is expected to reach 300 million by 2030. He added that the government is in the process of injecting $11 billion to construct new airports and expand the existing ones. The tourism world is watching two markets closely — India and China. With both countries representing vast populations, rising incomes, and an increasing appetite for travel, they are transforming the global tourism landscape. As China regains its position as a leading outbound travel market and India sees a surge in young, aspirational travelers, the potential is immense.

Priced at INR 6,900 in India, these earbuds face tough competition from the likes of OnePlus and Nothing. That said, their appeal doesn’t lie in the feature set but in their size. These are the most compact, good-sounding earbuds you can buy right now. But should you opt for a small and light design over a value-for-money and feature-rich pair of earbuds? Here’s what you need to know about the Beats Solo Buds before settling on your next earbuds. Beats Solo Buds case comparison with AirPods Pro 2 and the new AirPods 4 The Beats Solo Buds look like their more expensive siblings, the Studio Buds, but in a smaller, budget-focused case. I have the Black and Orange (festive special) variants, and I love the matte finish. The case is small enough to slide into the tiniest of pockets, thanks to a no-battery design – making them stand out among the competition. There’s also no notification light or pairing button on the case. When you open it, you get a notification sound that indicates they’re in pairing mode. The sound is also the only way to know they’re connected for charging. The lid is as solid as ever and gives a resounding click. The no-battery case design means it won’t charge your earbuds unless it’s connected to a power source with both buds inside. There’s a learning curve coming from previous earbuds because muscle memory expects them to be fully charged when you take them out out the case the second time – but they aren’t. Beats Solo Buds' earbuds Despite this, the earbuds themselves are small but mighty. They can last up to 18 hours on a single charge, which is astonishing given their size. Beats also claims that a five-minute charge gives you up to an hour of playback. Apart from sounding good, they fit well and form a tight seal in your ears. This is essential for passive noise cancellation since there’s no active noise cancellation (ANC). Also Read: Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Review: Superhit Sequel The Beats Solo Buds offer playback control with single, double, and triple taps, while volume or voice assistant control is managed with press and hold. These settings can be adjusted in the iOS Bluetooth settings or the Beats app for Android devices. While I still prefer earbuds with a charging case, there’s no denying the benefits of the small form factor. For instance, I might keep other earbuds in my backpack or sling bag, but I can grab these, easily toss them in my pocket and move on the go. Beats Solo Buds in Orange (festive-speacial) and Black Beats hasn’t compromised on sound quality. The Solo Buds sound like their pricier siblings, meaning you get excellent sound clarity. The bass is thumpy enough to be felt, with good depth in music that you’d expect from earbuds costing $120+. While they lack the richness of the Studio Buds Plus, these still sound fantastic for the price. The vocal clarity and treble performance are top-notch, too. The highs aren’t too bright, but there’s enough sparkle to make music more lively. Also Read: Sonos Ace Review: My New Favorite Travel Headphones Beats Solo Buds with festive-special packaging Although there’s no ANC, if you get a tight seal, these earbuds do a decent job of blocking out ambient noise in the mid-frequencies. You don’t get transparency mode or conversation detection, so you’ll need to either pause your music or take off the earbuds when talking to someone. The lack of features continues with no auto-switching between Apple devices, no hands-free Siri, and no Spatial Audio. The Beats Solo Buds come with good-quality mics, and callers mentioned that I sounded clear unless there was strong wind. They held up well during calls, even in the bustling traffic of Delhi, where the callers said they couldn’t hear much of it. Beats Solo Buds At $80 / INR 6,900, there are many more feature-rich earbuds on the market. The OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro, for instance, at the same price in the US (and INR 2,700 in India), offer more features and better controls. Similarly, Nothing and Soundcore earbuds in this price range boast more functionality – but the Beats earbuds stand on their own for two reasons. First, the Beats Solo Buds are for those who are platform-agnostic. Whether you have a Mac and iPhone, Android and Windows, or a mix of all four, the Solo Buds will perform the same. Their compact form factor is appealing, too. Second, despite their small size, they don’t skimp on sound quality. The Beats Solo Buds sound more expensive than they are and provide excellent voice call performance. They’re also easy to set up and carry around. The Beats Solo Buds are a great pick for those who prioritize portability and platform flexibility without compromising on sound and call quality. Pros: Cons: One Community. Many Voices.

Here's why.\", 'content': 'Mohamed Muizzu embarks on a state visit to India a year after becoming president on anti-India rhetoric. Here’s why. Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu has called India a “valued partner” on his first state visit to New Delhi in an effort to mend ties that were strained by Muizzu’s anti-India rhetoric during his election campaign. Muizzu’s pro-China stance and campaign to drive out Indian troops stationed in the archipelago nation threatened traditionally strong ties between the two Indian Ocean nations. After his election win in late 2023, the Maldivian leader, however, signalled a willingness to engage with India – and seems to have found a willing partner in New Delhi. “Maldives is India’s key maritime neighbour in the Indian Ocean Region,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement announcing Muizzu’s five-day visit, which began on Sunday. So why has Muizzu visited India, and what does it mean for India-Maldives ties? Muizzu was given a red carpet welcome, and his busy itinerary included meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top Indian officials. According to India’s foreign office, Muizzu and Modi discussed “energy, trade, financial linkages and defence cooperation”. Specifically, they talked about a free trade agreement. After the meeting, Modi said India would help the Maldives develop infrastructure projects. India approved a $400m currency swap agreement to support the cash-strapped Maldivian economy. Muizzu said this agreement “will be instrumental in addressing the foreign exchange issues we are facing right now”. The two leaders also virtually inaugurated a runway at Hanimaadhoo International Airport in the Maldives. Take a look at the list of outcomes of the visit: pic.twitter.com/LACeI9xdlG — Randhir Jaiswal (@MEAIndia) October 7, 2024 The Maldives is grappling with a budget deficit and debt burden. It faces the prospect of defaulting on debt repayments with its foreign reserves falling to $440m. The Maldives, which heavily borrowed from China during former President Abdulla Yameen’s term, owes Beijing $1.37bn, according to World Bank data. New Delhi is also a major source of credit for Male. Muizzu visited Beijing in January, signing infrastructure and climate deals with China, but he has not burned bridges with New Delhi. Historically, Male has cultivated friendly ties with New Delhi. Yameen, a former ally of Muizzu, forged closer China ties and signed big infrastructure projects. “Muizzu has been trying to better balance the relations between the Maldives and China and the Maldives and India,” Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center, told Al Jazeera. While Muizzu has demonstrated a desire to strengthen ties with China, “particularly on the defence side,” he has continued to work closely with India in other areas, “particularly when it comes to commercial and economic ties,” said Kugelman. The island nation’s economy is largely driven by its tourism sector, which makes up nearly a third of its GDP. The 1,192 islands in the archipelago are home to an array of luxury resorts. But the COVID-19 pandemic and later the strained ties with India hit the economy badly. More than 200,000 Indians visited the Maldives in 2023 – the highest from any country. But the numbers dipped by 42 percent this year, amid tensions following Muizzu’s election. India is also a major trade partner of the Maldives. “I think that Muizzu does recognise that there can’t be any impression that he wants to back away from India and all of the critical economic and development support that entails,” Kugelman said. Muizzu’s People’s National Congress (PNC) and its ally Progressive Party of the Maldives (PPM), led by Yameen, campaigned on the promise to evict a small contingent of Indian troops from the Maldives over opposition fears that the presence of Indian soldiers posed a danger to its sovereignty. Mohamed Saeed, a senior leader from Muizzu’s PNC, said, “We are not against the people of India.” “Our people just want the Indian military to leave. We are a very fragile country. We cannot afford to have any military presence of another country here,” he told TRT World when the “India Out” campaign was launched in 2020 when pro-India Ibrahim Solih was president. According to New Delhi, Indian forces were tasked with operating the two helicopters and one aircraft India had donated to the Maldives. But opposition parties alleged there was a plan for a permanent Indian military base in the island nation. A leaked document released in the local media said an India-funded dockyard for the Maldivian coastguard would be used by Indian navy vessels for years. The opposition asked why such an important deal was not debated in parliament. Solih was accused of signing a secret defence deal with India, an accusation the government denied as it accused the opposition parties of “spreading lies”. “India has always been the Maldives’ closest ally and trusted neig.'}, {'title': 'How to Get Tickets to Coldplay’s 2025 US, Canadian Tour Dates', 'link': 'https://consequence.net/2024/10/coldplay-2025-north-american-tour-how-to-get-tickets/', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': 'Coldplay are bringing their record-setting \"Music of the Spheres World Tour\" back to North America in 2025.

The tycoon led the Tata Group - known as a \"salt-to-software\" conglomerate of more than 100 companies, employing some 660,000 people - for more than two decades. Its annual revenues are in excess of $100bn (£76.5bn). Founded by Jamsetji Tata, a pioneer of Indian business, the 155-year-old Tata Group straddles a business empire ranging from Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to aviation and salt pans. The ethos of the company \"yokes capitalism to philanthropy, by doing business in ways that make the lives of others better\", according to Peter Casey, author of The Story of Tata, an authorised book on the group. Tata Sons, the holding company of the group, has a \"number of companies that includes privately held and publicly traded companies, yet they are in essence all owned by a philanthropic trust\", he explains. Ratan Tata was born in 1937 in a traditional family of Parsis - a highly educated and prosperous community that traces its ancestry to Zoroastrian refugees in India. His parents separated in the 1940s. Tata went to college in the US, where he got a degree in architecture at Cornell University. During his seven-year-long stay, he learned to drive cars and fly. He had some harrowing experiences: he once lost an engine while flying a helicopter in college and twice lost the single engine in his plane. \"So I had to glide in,\" he told an interviewer. Later, he would often fly his company\\'s business jet. He returned to India in 1962 when his grandmother Lady Navajbai fell ill and called for him. It was then that JRD Tata - a relative from a different branch of the family - asked him to join the Tata Group. \"He [JRD Tata] was my greatest mentor... he was like a father and a brother to me - and not enough has been said about that,\" Tata told an interviewer. Ratan Tata was sent to a company steel plant in Jamshedpur in eastern India where he spent a couple of years on the factory floor before becoming the technical assistant to the manager. In the early 70s, he took over two ailing group firms, one making radios and TVs and the other textiles. He managed to turn around the first, and had mixed results with the textile company. In 1991, JRD Tata, who had led the group for over half a century, appointed Ratan Tata as his successor over senior company aspirants for that position. \"If you were to find the publications of that time, the criticism was personal - JRD got clubbed with nepotism and I was branded as the wrong choice,\" Ratan Tata later said. Peter Casey writes that under Ratan Tata\\'s leadership, a \"great but rather stodgy Indian manufacturer began emerging as a global brand with great emphasis on consumer goods\". But the journey was a mixed one. During his tenure the group made many bold acquisitions, among them the takeover of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus and UK-based car brands Jaguar and Land Rover. Some of those decisions paid off, while others - including a failed telecom venture - have cost the company a lot of money. A high point came in 2000, when Tata bought Tetley and became the world\\'s second-largest tea company. The deal was the largest takeover of an international brand by an Indian company. A few years later, a visiting journalist from a UK-based newspaper asked Tata whether he liked the irony of an Indian company buying a leading British brand. \"Tata is too shrewd and too shy to be caught gloating about his successes like some territory-grabbing East India Company nabob,\" the journalist later wrote. Tata\\'s foray into building a safe, affordable car turned out to be a disappointment. It was launched amid great fanfare in 2009 as a compact with the base model costing just 100,000 rupees ($1,222; £982). But after the initial success and euphoria, the brand began to lose out to other manufacturers due to issues with production and marketing. Tata later said it was a \"huge mistake to brand Nano as the world\\'s cheapest car. People don\\'t want to be seen driving the world\\'s cheapest car!\" His resilience was also tested during the Mumbai terror attacks of 26 November, 2008. Tata\\'s marquee Taj Mahal Palace was one of the two luxury hotels that was attacked, along with a train station, a hospital, a Jewish cultural centre, and some other targets in Mumbai. Thirty-three of the 166 people who died in the 60-hour siege were at the Taj. This included 11 hotel employees, a third of the hotel\\'s total casualties. Tata pledged to look after the families of employees who were killed or injured, and paid the relatives of those killed the salaries they would have earned for the rest of their lives. He also spent more than $1bn to restore the damaged hotel within 21 months. Towards the end of his career, Tata found himself embroiled in an unsavoury controversy. In October 2016 he returned to Tata Sons as interim chairman for a few months after the previous incumbent, Cyrus Mistry, was ousted, sparking a bitter m.'}, {'title': 'Why Air Canada Aeroplan has become my favorite Star Alliance loyalty program', 'link': 'https://thepointsguy.com/news/air-canada-aeroplan-best-star-alliance-program/', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': 'Even if you travel on many different airlines, it makes sense to focus on just one loyalty program in each of the Big Three airline alliances: Oneworld, Star Alliance and SkyTeam.

You\\'ll pay based on your flight length, but pricing varies based on the regions you fly to and from, with regions being very broadly defined. For example, the \"Atlantic\" region covers everything from Norway to South Africa to India. Once you have decided which region(s) you want to travel to, you can check the distance of your itinerary (using a tool like Great Circle Mapper). Then, based on the award charts, you can determine how many Aeroplan points you will need to redeem for the flight. For example, you could fly on Singapore Airlines\\' fifth-freedom route from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Frankfurt Airport (FRA) in Germany for just 60,000 Aeroplan points in business class plus about $57 in taxes and fees. This is an incredible deal on one of the world\\'s best airlines in business class to Europe. You can also book economy flights on United Airlines within the continental U.S. and Canada from just 6,000 Aeroplan points for flights up to 500 miles in length, such as from Dulles International Airport (IAD) to many Northeast destinations. Aeroplan also does not have carrier-imposed surcharges, which can save you hundreds of dollars compared with redeeming through a program that does impose these surcharges.

Ahead of a state funeral, hundreds of people including corporate leaders, politicians and celebrities gathered in India\\'s financial hub Mumbai to pay their last respects to Tata, who died aged 86 on Wednesday.Known for his exemplary business acumen and philanthropic nature, Tata as chairman led various companies within the Tata conglomerate for more than 20 years.

Tata had been in a Mumbai hospital since Monday, but the cause of his death was not immediately made public. After his death, tributes poured in from around the world, underlining a popularity that transcended boundaries and generations. \"India and the world have lost a giant with a giant heart,\" US Ambassador Eric Garcetti said on X regarding Tata, who was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India\\'s second-highest civilian honour.

In September, we experienced three incidents that resulted in degraded performance across GitHub services. September 16 21:11 UTC (lasting 57 minutes) On September 16, 2024, between 21:11 UTC and 22:08 UTC, GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages services were degraded. Customers who deploy Pages from a source branch experienced delayed runs. We determined the root cause to be a misconfiguration in the service that manages runner connections that led to CPU throttling and performance degradation in that service. Actions jobs experienced average delays of 23 minutes, with some jobs experiencing delays as high as 45 minutes. During the course of the incident, 17% of runs were delayed by more than five minutes. At peak, as many as 80% of runs experienced delays exceeding five minutes. We mitigated the incident by diverting runner connections away from the misconfigured nodes, starting at 21:16 UTC. In addition to addressing the configuration issue we discovered through this, we have improved our general monitoring to reduce the risk of a similar recurrence and reduce our time to automated detection and mitigation of issues like this in the future. September 24 08:20 UTC (lasting 44 minutes) On September 24, 2024 from 08:20 UTC to 09:04 UTC the GitHub Codespaces service experienced an interruption in network connectivity, leading to an approximate 25% error rate for the outage period. We traced the cause to an interruption in network connectivity caused by Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) port exhaustion following a deployment, causing individual codespaces to lose their connection to the service. To mitigate the impact, we increased port allocations to give enough buffer for increased outbound connections shortly after deployments. We will be scaling up our outbound connectivity in the near future, as well as adding improved monitoring of network capacity to prevent future regressions. September 30 10:43 UTC (lasting 43 minutes) On September 30, 2024 from 10:43 UTC to 11:26 UTC GitHub Codespaces customers in the Central India region were unable to create new codespaces. Resumes were not impacted and there was no impact to customers in other regions. We traced the cause to storage capacity constraints in the region and mitigated by temporarily redirecting create requests to other regions. Afterwards, we added additional storage capacity to the region and traffic was routed back. We also identified a bug that caused some available capacity not to be utilized, artificially constraining capacity and halting creations in the region prematurely. We have since fixed this bug as well so that available capacity scales as expected according to our capacity planning projections.

(via Cult of Mac - Apple news, rumors, reviews and how-tos)', 'content': 'By Ed Hardy • 7:47 am, October 10, 2024 In an episode that Taiwan describes as “bizarre,” China reportedly detained four employees at a plant that makes Apple products. The facility is owned by Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, but it is located in Zhengzhou, China. Relations between the two countries are tense. When the Communist Party took over mainland China at the end of the Chinese Civil War, the former government of the country retreated to Taiwan and declared independence in 1949. Many decades later, China still considers Taiwan a breakaway province and periodically threatens to reconquer the island. China recently threatened to arrest and even execute what it calls “Taiwan independence die-hards,” according to The Wall Street Journal. And that may include the four Foxconn employees detained by local authorities. The WSJ spoke with Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council. “The council described the allegations as bizarre and said improper detention could severely damage investor confidence in China,” the WSJ reported. “It urged Chinese authorities to conduct a swift and transparent investigation into the matter.” Apple is caught in the middle. As noted, the employees work at the giant Foxconn facility where iPhone and other Apple products are assembled. But such events are among the reasons Apple and Foxconn are working to transition iPhone assembly to India.'}, {'title': 'Air India orders an additional 85 Airbus aircraft, including 10 A350 Jets', 'link': 'https://livefromalounge.com/air-india-orders-85-airbus-jets/', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': 'Air India has made some significant adjustments to the order book, enhancing its appetite for Airbus aircraft, with another 85 added to the existing orders.

As a part of the Airbus share of these aircraft, there were 210 A320family aircraft on order (140 A321neos and 70 A320s), 20 A350-900s and 20 A350-1000 aircraft. Airbus delivered six A350-900 aircraft, initially designated for Aeroflot, to Air India along with the original product selected. Air India will now receive 34 A350-900/1000 aircraft, factory-fresh and manufactured to Air India’s specifications. At the time of the order, Air India was the first and only customer of the A350 widebody in India. IndiGo has subsequently placed an order for A350 aircraft as well. Air India’s first A350-900 aircraft being prepared for delivery in Toulouse. Picture Credit: Nuno Seletti (@NunoSeletti on Twitter) Air India orders more A320family and A350 aircraft. As part of its monthly reporting about orders and deliveries, Airbus reported yesterday that on September 5, 2024, a customer placed an order for 85 aircraft with Airbus. “Undisclosed”, as these orders turn up, is when the airline does not want to reveal its orders as there may be internal processes ongoing, or the airline might just be looking for a suitable time to disclose the orders. Bloomberg now reports that the “undisclosed” customer might be Air India. While they don’t have an official comment from Airbus or Air India, they report this based on discussions with “people familiar with the matter.” Per Airbus’s disclosures yesterday, the airline has ordered an additional 55 A321neo aircraft, 20 A320neo aircraft, and five additional A350-900s and -1000s each. Reuters says that Boeing may similarly get a second “add-on” order shortly. The supplementary order might look like a small change compared to the earlier order. Still, the airline is absorbing as much capacity as it can avail of itself in a rush to undo the undercapacity of the past. Air India already has a fleet of 140 aircraft (including 60 widebodies – 777, 787 and A350s), and in a month from now, it will absorb Vistara, which has a fleet of 70 aircraft, including 6 787-9 aircraft of its own. The airline faces competition from IndiGo, which currently has over 375 aircraft in its fleet (including those grounded for engine issues) and 950 aircraft on order (including 30 A350-900 planes). Ironically, the disclosure comes after the news about the Tata Group patriarch Ratan Tata’s passing last night. Customers lead such announcements, and we may have to wait a while before the airline confirms the order to the world at large. Bottomline Air India, which had 470 aircraft on order from Boeing and Airbus, has reportedly signed another order of 85 aircraft with Airbus, but the order has yet to be officially revealed. If confirmed, Airbus would have won Air India to supply another 75 narrowbody jets and 10 A350 widebody aircraft in the coming years. What do you make of these additions to the Air India order book?

The company will use the funds to capture market leadership and accelerate global growth by expanding its go-to-market, research and engineering teams. The latest investment brings its total funding raised to $29 million. Over the past year, watchTowr has seen significant adoption from critical infrastructure and Fortune 500 companies looking to strengthen their security measures. Advancements in AI are rapidly increasing the types and modality of exploits to large businesses. Human experts and cybersecurity products of the past will not be able to protect against the speed of these attacks. Built by offensive security experts, watchTowr simulates the ingenuity and persistence of attackers and enables organizations to rapidly react to emerging techniques and threats. watchTowr’s platform also builds a real-time attacker’s view of an organization, while continuously identifying and validating exploitable vulnerabilities and weaknesses before attacks occur. watchTowr was founded by hacker-turned-entrepreneur Benjamin Harris. Benjamin has built a remarkable profile in the cybersecurity industry over 14 years after having hacked into his school network at the age of 16. Since then, he has been helping companies around the world strengthen their cybersecurity defense and processes. “If there’s a way to compromise your organization, watchTowr will find it,” said Benjamin Harris, CEO, watchTowr. “In the last 12 months, our predictions have been realized. Attackers have become faster at weaponizing emerging vulnerabilities, more aggressive at leveraging weaknesses to compromise organizations indiscriminately, and time to exploitation in the wild is now measured in single-digit hours. We strongly believe that rapid reaction to these threats is one of the most powerful capabilities security teams can leverage.” Backed by the company’s research, the watchTowr Platform is the fastest to leverage the latest vulnerabilities, tactics and techniques used by sophisticated adversaries, enabling organizations to test their defenses. watchTowr Labs, the company’s threat and vulnerability R&D capability, has also become globally renowned. watchTowr Labs recently demonstrated compromise of entire portions of Internet infrastructure, was the first in February 2024 to analyze and reproduce vulnerabilities used by APT groups to compromise western government entities in Ivanti’s Connect Secure VPN product (CVE-2024-22024), and has consistently been the first to provide analysis for many of 2024’s most severe vulnerabilities. In addition to funding, the company also announced the appointment of former Cloudflare President of Field Operations & Chief Revenue Officer Chris Merritt to its board of directors to help guide watchTowr’s global growth. Merritt spent over ten years at Cloudflare, helping the company scale to over $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Today, he serves as an Operating Partner at Peak XV. “watchTowr has an incredible team, technology and opportunity,” added Merritt. “They’re solving a major challenge for global organizations by enabling them to view their systems like trained adversaries, validate weaknesses and help stop breaches – at scale. watchTowr is seeing incredible interest, and we look forward to helping Ben and the rest of the team cement their future as the next market-leader in cybersecurity.”.'}, {'title': 'The U.S., EU, and India must urgently come together in a free trade agreement on clean energy, says the CEO of one of India’s largest renewables company', 'link': 'https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/us-eu-india-urgent-free-trade-agreement-clean-energy-renewables-china-environment-politics/', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': 'India is much better placed than the U.S. or the EU to replicate many of the variables that help Chinese producers dominate green industries.', 'content': 'Sumant Sinha is the chairman and CEO of ReNew. There is much debate about how the macro environment, including the elections in the U.S. and monetary policy changes in key economies, might impact the fight against climate change. However, a key aspect of meeting clean energy targets will be the development of a de-risked global supply chain capable of delivering both materials and components to support the rapidly expanding demand. Clean energy supply chains are long, complex, and capital-intensive. Even if manufacturing is set up at home for some parts of the supply chain, re-shoring production of every single step to Western countries is a gargantuan industrial task. India is much better placed than the U.S. or the EU to replicate many of the variables that help Chinese producers dominate green industries. These variables include land prices, electricity costs, permitting timelines, construction timelines, construction costs, labor costs, and supply chain sourcing (just to name a few). It is in the geopolitical interest of major economies to support India in achieving the scale, efficiencies, and expertise needed to compete effectively with China. The U.S., EU, and India must urgently come together in a free trade agreement on clean energy. Countries like Mexico and Vietnam are only at the first step of diversification, focusing on the assembly of components to put together products such as solar modules or battery packs. Risks of disruption will only truly reduce when the value chain further upstream is diversified too, including the manufacturing of intermediate products (like polysilicon, wafers, ingots, and cells for solar; cathode, anodes, and cells for batteries), as well as the technologies and processed minerals needed to manufacture these intermediate products, and even mining and processing ores needed as raw materials. Much of this is technologically complex, capital and time-intensive, and energy and emissions-intensive. Through initiatives such as the Production-Linked Incentive scheme for alternate battery chemistries and integrated solar manufacturing facilities, India has already kickstarted backward integration. It is also set to launch the Critical Minerals Mission to catalyze investments in the mining and processing of critical minerals. To meet international 2030 emissions targets, the global manufacturing capacity needed for solar PV modules must rise to 651 GW, 400 GW for wind turbines, 167 GW for hydrogen electrolyzers, and 5099 GWh for EV batteries, according to the IEA. A recent statement from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy revealed that India has already increased its solar modules manufacturing capacity to 67 GW, a 27x increase in the last 10 years, accounting for 10% of the global requirement. The government has offered financial incentives to companies to set up 1.5 GW capacity of electrolyzers, the main technology to produce green hydrogen from water. Battery manufacturing projects will create a manufacturing capacity of a minimum of 120 GWh by 2030, which will result in a 10-fold increase in India’s share of global battery manufacturing capacity, from 0.2% currently to 2% in 2030. Reports show that China is a leading investor across the majority of clean energy manufacturing investments in Southeast Asian nations, likely in a bid to bypass trade barriers. By contrast, a majority of investments into the Indian clean energy manufacturing ecosystem are from a diversified investor base, primarily from India but also from the U.S., Japan, and others. This helps India’s positioning as a trusted source for supplies of clean energy equipment. Ultimately, quality and pricing matter. As the CEO of a company involved in both the manufacturing of solar modules and cells and their use in electricity generation, I can confidently say that modules, cells, batteries, and electrolyzers made in India meet the highest international standards, as evidenced by the rapidly rising exports from India to the U.S. and EU. Competitiveness on pricing is trickier. Industry estimates indicate that production costs for Chinese suppliers are between 15-25% lower than other international players across technologies such as solar modules, cells, batteries, electrolyzers, and wind turbines. However, Chinese suppliers are offering products at almost 40-50% of the prices being offered by players from other countries. This mismatch has led to a spate of non-tariff barriers, anti-dumping duties, and investigations initiated by several markets including the U.S., India, and the EU. Clean energy is an area ripe for stronger international collaboration. Even though building domestic supply chain capabilities opens possibilities of a huge economic prize for host countries, multiple hubs are critical to nudging domestic manufacturers toward gaining international competitiveness (especially as subsidies are time- and resource-capped) as well as to leverage respective strengths for faster innovation and cost r.'}, {'title': 'Video: Wikipedia vs ANI—All About the Delhi HC Case and How it Can Affect Information Flow in India', 'link': 'https://www.medianama.com/2024/10/223-video-delhi-hc-action-wikipedia-ani-defamation-lawsuit-affect-india/', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': 'Can Wikipedia lose its safe harbour protections in India?

Justice Navin Chawla even warned that it would shut the website’s operations in India. Wikipedia claimed that the delay was caused due to its headquarters being located abroad. ANI filed a defamation lawsuit against Wikipedia, seeking Rs 2 crore in damages on July 9, 2024 alleging that the description on its page was defamatory. It sought removal of the content while the Court issued summons to Wikipedia ordering it to share information about the three users who made the edits on ANI’s page. The news organisation has argued Section 79 of the Information Technology Act (2000) concerning safe harbour does not protect Wikipedia since it is used as a public utility and thus, cannot behave as a private actor. In this video, MediaNama Founder and Editor Nikhil Pahwa discusses how the court’s decision can impact safe harbour protections and information flows in India. “Overly aggressive enforcement against global platforms ……banning platforms themselves because of some violations such as this can basically stifle the flow of information and knowledge.

In February, Disney and Indian conglomerate Reliance agreed to merge media platforms Star India and Viacom 18 in a $3.1 billion pact. Barely a month later, private equity firm Silver Lake struck a $13 billion deal to take entertainment conglomerate Endeavor private while Liberty Media agreed to pay $4.6 billion for Dorna Sports, the commercial rights holder of the MotoGP World Championship. Those deals provided a jolt, but they weren’t the only transactions shaking up the sports tech industry. The first six months of 2024 featured three other mergers and acquisitions worth at least $1 billion, and a record 225 in the sector overall, according to a report released by investment bank Drake Star on Thursday. The total disclosed value amounted to $27.3 billion—also a half-year high, according to the bank. The period far outpaced both the first half of 2023 ($16.1 billion on 165 deals) and the second half ($8.6 billion on 163 transactions). “Sports as an asset class is the red-hot sector as of now, [and it’s] one category where there is a maximum amount of activity happening,” says Mohit Pareek, a principal at Drake Star and co-author of the report. “Whether you talk about the digital media rights, whether you talk about all the FAANGs moving into it—Apple, Amazon—everyone is trying to get a piece of the sports puzzle.” That wasn’t always the case. “There was an old adage in capital: ‘No one’s ever made a penny on sports,’” Paul Martino, cofounder of venture fund Bullpen Capital, recalls from his early days as an angel investor. But that narrative has shifted as team values have exploded over the last two decades. In Forbes’ recent ranking of the NFL’s most valuable teams, for instance, the average franchise value was $5.7 billion, up 11% from 2023 and 77% since 2020. Still, as the price tags rise, and as leagues maintain strict ownership requirements, it’s getting harder and harder to nab one of the few team stakes that come up for sale. And while several pro leagues have recently eased their rules around private equity and other institutional capital, that path to team ownership is also available to only a select few with massive resources. Instead, investors desperate to dive into the sports sector appear to be turning to adjacent businesses, in areas such as wearables and performance enhancement (99 of the 225 M&A deals in Drake Star’s new report), fan engagement and experience (35), and media and broadcasting (20). Other categories of interest include data analytics, ticketing, venue management and—just as in every corner of the tech investing landscape—artificial intelligence. The vast majority of the mergers and acquisitions in Drake Star’s report involve earlier-stage startups, with transactions ranging from $30 million to $500 million. That dovetails with a decline in private financing, with fundraising in the first half of 2024 down to $1.9 billion across 342 deals, according to Drake Star, from $3.3 billion on 354 deals in the first half of 2023 and $2.4 billion on 360 deals in the second half. The upshot: As consolidation sweeps across the sports world, small startups are being forced to sell to their bigger competitors, rather than try to grow on their own. Martino, who invested in FanDuel in 2010, cites the example of a fantasy sports startup he is advising. The concept may be exciting, and the founder may be well connected, but the reality is that FanDuel and DraftKings now have overwhelming market share, and customer acquisition costs are now 10 to 100 times what they used to be. “If you’re a new young entrant, you have to go to market with some incumbent support, or else you’re never going to get any audience,” Martino says. With that backdrop—and with roughly $7.5 billion that was raised in 2023 still largely undeployed—Drake Star’s Pareek forecasts a similar number of sports tech M&A deals for the rest of 2024, or slightly more, even if the total transaction value is likely to come down in the absence of an Endeavor-size acquisition. The sector may also continue to outpace other industries, even though many are performing well, too. “The whole rest of the market’s still asleep at the switch,” Martino says. “I feel like while the rest of the world is a little crazy, our category is behaving the way it should be when there’s perceived growth and incumbents have lots of money on their balance sheet and high stock valuations.” Verlinvest, a family-backed investment firm that generally makes deals between $50 million and $250 million, seems to be among the converts. While the firm traditionally comes from the food and beverage world, with stakes in brands such as Vita Coco and Oatly, it recently made an undisclosed investment in K1 Speed, an electric go-kart racing business. “What we’ve observed is a shift away from [consumer packaged goo.\"}, {'title': 'Commentary: Ratan Tata’s vision should still be India’s', 'link': 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/india-ratan-tata-group-narendra-modi-manufacturing-4670551', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': 'A true corporate titan, he always benchmarked himself and Tata Group against the world’s best. So should the rest of India, says Bloomberg Opinion’s Mihir Sharma.', 'content': 'Commentary A true corporate titan, he always benchmarked himself and Tata Group against the world’s best. So should the rest of India, says Bloomberg Opinion’s Mihir Sharma. NEW DELHI: In India, the Tata name is ubiquitous. People see it on the packet of tea that wakes them up in the morning, on the buses that carry them to work, and in the hotels where they go for a drink after work. No other name is as representative of the possibilities, and failures, of the nation’s private sector – and so all Indians will have felt the passing of the group’s patriarch Ratan Tata this week. In his ambition and through his mistakes, Tata captured the potential of a global, modern India. The centuries-old conglomerate he led has grown along with his country, from the first stirrings of an industrial economy in the subcontinent with its steel plant in Jamshedpur, through the dreary years of socialism and the burst of post-liberalisation optimism. Ratan Tata took over in 1990, a year before India began to deregulate and open up. Under him, a group that made steel, trucks and chemicals quickly diversified into small cars and information technology. The shift exemplified India’s move away from a state-directed, capital-intensive growth model to one based on consumer demand and services exports. Today, Tata Consultancy Services accounts for the largest share of the group’s value. Unfortunately, de-industrialisation has not worked out so well for the rest of the country. A services-led economy can’t quite produce enough jobs, nor does it appear able to ensure economic security. India’s current government is desperately working to turn back the clock with sweeping industrial policies. But transforming a high-cost, relatively uncompetitive manufacturing sector has proved to be a difficult task. Perhaps that’s because Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts have tended to focus on tariffs, subsidies and protection for domestic manufacturers, rather than on improving productivity. The government would like companies to stay home and indigenise their entire supply chains. Tata Sons Chief Executive Officer N Chandrashekharan agreeably promised Modi in 2022 at the opening of a new airplane plant that “Tata Group will now be able to take aluminium ingots at one end of the value stream and turn it into an Airbus C295 aircraft for the Indian Air Force at the other.” The Tatas are also building, in response to a push from the government, three semiconductor fabrication factories and one chip testing and assembly complex. Ratan Tata’s own instincts seemed to have nudged him in a different direction. While he never gave up on manufacturing, he always believed that Indian companies should be global. He used Tata Consultancy Services’ profits to make big bets on both – wagers that didn’t always pay off. In 2008, Tata Motors bought Jaguar Land Rover. That deal might be considered a success, given that the company reported its highest revenues since 2015 last year. Other decisions don’t look so good in hindsight. In 2007, Tata bought Corus Group, which made steel in the plants that used to belong to the Dutch and British national producers, Koninklijke Hoogovens and British Steel, respectively. Tata probably overpaid and has lost billions on that bet; the former British Steel’s last blast furnace just shut down. The week that Ratan Tata passed is also the first week in centuries that no steel is being poured in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, India trusted his judgement, even in matters of politics: When Tata Motors picked Modi-run Gujarat as the location for a new car factory in 2008, it was seen as a sign that the private sector trusted then-controversial Modi above all other chief ministers. The country followed Tata’s lead a few years later. Why not also back his commercial instincts? India’s ambitions should be global, not local. Its companies should manufacture in and for the world, not just focus on the domestic market. Whatever his faults, Ratan Tata always benchmarked himself and his group’s products against the world’s best. The rest of India should, too. I grew up in Jamshedpur, the beautiful company town that the Tatas built around their giant steel plant. Ratan Tata was already a larger-than-life figure then. Jamshedpur, with its world-class facilities, its orderliness and its productivity, seemed a harbinger of what India could become. The country may not have lived up to that promise yet, but, like Ratan Tata, it shouldn’t stop believing.

Tata, who died aged 86 on Wednesday, transformed the Tata Group into a sprawling international enterprise, with a portfolio ranging from software to sports cars. His coffin, draped in an Indian flag, was flanked by a guard of honour, with a marching band of trumpets and drums accompanying the procession. Mumbai has declared a day of mourning, with the funeral rites to take place on Thursday afternoon. \"A titan of Indian industry\", The Hindu newspaper called him on its front-page. \"India loses its crown jewel\", the Hindustan Times wrote. Tributes also poured in from fellow industrialists, with Asia\\'s richest man Mukesh Ambani saying it was a \"big loss, not just to the Tata group, but to every Indian\". Tata was born in Mumbai in 1937 into a family of Parsis -- a proud but dwindling community which played an outsized role in the city\\'s business affairs under British rule. He had intended to chart his own course in life as an architect after graduating from Cornell University in New York. But an appeal from his grandmother saw him return to India in 1962 and join the sprawling family business, beginning work as a factory floor labourer and sleeping in a hostel for trainees. He took over the family empire in 1991, riding the wave of the radical free-market reforms India had just unleashed that year. Tata\\'s 21 years at its helm saw the salt-to-steel conglomerate expand its global footprint. His 2008 decision to purchase Britain\\'s loss-making Jaguar and Land Rover carmakers for $2.3 billion burnished his reputation when Tata Group was able to restructure both brands and return them to profit the following year. The Tata Group said his philanthropy work \"touched the lives of millions.\" \"From education to healthcare, his initiatives have left a deep-rooted mark that will benefit generations to come,\" the company added.

Tata Group is a sprawling collection of nearly 100 companies, including Tata Motors, the country\\'s largest automaker; Tata Steel, the largest private steel company; Tata Power; and the information technology company Tata Consultancy Services. They employ more than 350,000 people worldwide with a presence in over 100 countries. Its products are ubiquitous in Indian homes and include daily necessities such as salt, tea and mineral water. In June 2008, Tata bought Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford for $2.3 billion US. A year earlier, it took over Britain-based steel maker Corus for $12 billion US. At that time, Corus\\'s annual steel production was four times higher than that of Tata Steel. Tata Group pioneered commercial aviation in India by launching an airline in 1932 that later became Air India. The government later took it over. Tata Group then bought Air India from the government in 2021. It also started a full-service carrier, Vistara, with Singapore Airlines, but recently merged it with Air India. In 2009, the company surprised the automobile industry by launching Tata Nano, a tiny vehicle with a rear engine costing about 100,000 rupees (then $2,000 US). Publicized as a \"People\\'s Car,\" it could seat up to five adults. Ratan Tata said at the time that it would provide a \"safe, affordable, all-weather form of transport\" for millions of middle- and lower-income Indian consumers. However, due to low sales, the company stopped production of the tiny car in 2018. Ratan Tata joined the Tata Group in 1961 and succeeded J.R.D. Tata as chairman after the latter\\'s retirement in 1991. That followed the liberalization of India\\'s economy in 1990, bringing massive economic reforms and global investment in the country. In December 2012, Tata retired as chairman of Tata Group. He briefly served as interim chairman beginning in October 2016 following the ouster of his successor, Cyrus Mistry. He returned to retirement in 2017, when Chandrasekaran was appointed chairman of Tata Group.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa addresses the opening ceremony of the 2024 Forum for China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Summit at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, Sep. 5, 2024. In his opening speech at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) summit on September 5, Chinese President Xi Jinping remarked, “China and Africa’s joint pursuit of modernization will set off a wave of modernization in the Global South and open a new chapter in our drive for a community with a shared future for mankind.” According to Xi, this joint path to modernization would be distinct from the Western model, which “has inflicted immense sufferings on developing countries.” However, Beijing’s pitch to jointly pursue modernization with African countries comes at a time when China is reducing loans and investments in Africa and facing growing scrutiny from recipient countries about the viability of Chinese-led projects. According to Boston University’s Global China Initiative, the value of Chinese loans in 2023 ($4.6 billion) was just a fraction of the amount given in 2016 ($28.4 billion). Hence, Xi’s call for a modernization partnership indicates a change in gears, with Beijing seeking to compensate for less financial firepower by focusing more on governance and capacity building. It signals a shift in China’s Global South strategy, which has matured in tandem with changing domestic priorities and international environment. Any type of response or alternative engagement – including by an India that seeks to be the voice of the Global South – must therefore first appreciate the conceptual definition of “modernization” from a Chinese perspective. Chinese-style modernization (中国式现代化) first prominently appeared in the ideological parlance of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 2021 in the important resolution on CCP history issued by the Sixth Plenum of the 19th Central Committee. The phrase has since been incorporated as a key component of the Xi Jinping Thought. Its messaging is both inward-looking and outward-facing. Domestically, it asserts the centrality of the CCP’s rule and a new form of “high quality development” that focuses on boosting domestic demand, technologically advanced industries, ecological protection, and creating a more equitable society. The external messaging has become consolidated in the Global Civilization Initiative, Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative. It involves four main tenets. First, Chinese-style modernization is hinged on economic globalization and openness. China has benefited significantly from the open trade, market access, and investments under the U.S.-led Western institutions. In the last decade, Chinese leaders have repeatedly spoken against the ongoing wave of economic nationalism and deglobalization. However, this is not a call to go back to the neoliberal withdrawal of the state. In China’s vision, globalization is rather to be guided by a strong state that enjoys an upper hand over both market forces and international institutions. From the Chinese side as well, it is the party-state, and not the private sector, that is the face of China’s outreach. Second, Chinese-style modernization challenges the notion of modernization being akin to Westernization and offers an alternative to the developing world. Portraying colonial exploitation in Africa and China’s “century of humiliation” as “the historical injustices of the modernization process,” Xi argued for a joint pursuit of modernization built on a relationship of equality, sincerity, and amity. This has two visible manifestations: first, an insistence on non-interference in domestic political affairs even as China develops relations across ideological and political spectrums; and second, instead of conditional loans and adjustment programs, a focus on training and sharing governance strategies. This is aimed at shaping governance systems in China’s own image and increasing the legitimacy of the Communist regime in China. For example, at FOCAC, Xi pledged training programs in fields like law making, agriculture, scientific innovation, epidemic response, policing and law enforcement. The third important feature of Chinese-style modernization is the “mutual reinforcement of high-quality development and greater security.” China asserts the superiority of its model in achieving the “rare” feat of a high level of economic development and social stability in a much shorter span of time than the West. Hence, the joint path to modernization is to be accompanied by China sharing its experience in party and state governance and helping countries to improve capacity in safeguarding peace and stability “independently.” China has also pledged military assistance grants, joint military exercises, as well as personnel exchange and trai.'}, {'title': 'Senia Co-Founders On New Engagement Rings And Family Legacy', 'link': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/nadjasayej/2024/10/10/senia-co-founders-on-new-engagement-rings-and-family-legacy/', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': \"The jewelry brand Senia has a long family history, and it hails back to the co-founders' great grandparents in Italy.\", 'content': \"Senia New York co-founders Gnia and Christina Senia Senia is more than just another sustainable jewelry brand. It was co-founded by two sisters, Christina and Gina Senia, who offer edgy designs, while putting their clientele’s comfort first. It's sustainable, too, made with precious metals and ethically sourced gemstones. Since starting the brand in 2020, their styles have been worn by Serena Williams, Hailey Bieber, Charli D’Amelio, Addison Rae, and their ethically sourced gemstones are mainly from Thailand and India. Their diamonds are “conflict free,” meaning that they are mined from areas that are not controlled by war. They work with manufacturers approved by the Responsible Jewelry Council, which prioritizes recycling. “That’s why we aim to design jewelry where new styles can be created from existing pieces,” said Gina Senia. “We marry form and function and empower our community to re-assemble their pieces throughout the lifetime of the product, transcending trends.” Chain rings by Senia New York Senia ties into their family legacy, as the Senia sisters’ great-grandparents were jewelers in Italy in the early 1900s. “Our journey began with a surprising revelation about our family's rich history in jewelry-making, which we discovered a year after launching our business,” said Christina Senia. Their great-grandparents were forced to leave Europe during World War II and fled to Africa. “This legacy of craftsmanship, particularly our great-grandfather's technique of hand-carving jewels from solid wax blocks, has been a profound inspiration for us, especially in launching our jewelry sculpting classes which empower our community to create their own jewelry by hand that we then cast into golden pieces,” she said. Engagement ring that locks into a necklace while you work, protecting your jewelry, by Senia The designs of their rings, earrings and chains nod to traditional styles with edgy details; a delicate balance between contemporary and classic. Just look at their pearl studs, which incorporate oblong gold details, or their veil earrings, which have a charming chain drop. “We take classic pieces and create a slightly more daring approach,” said Christina Senia. “The result is a line of jewelry that's versatile, personal, and always evolving – just like the tastes and styles of our diverse clientele.” Engagement ring and necklace that holds it (while you work) by Senia Their latest collection of earrings and necklaces are inspired by the Italian Cornicello, an amulet shaped like a chili pepper, that is said to protect the wearer. “We wanted to pay homage to both our great grandfather and our heritage,” said Gina Senia. They reinvent the Cornicello with a Senia edge—a more modern design of this symbol in 14k gold. “These lucky and protective amulets are borrowed from our family heirlooms and reborn for the modern wearer,” she adds. Horn ring by Senia, inspired by the Italian Cornicello The brand’s bestseller is their Chain Rings, a set of two rings sold together, which are connected by a gold chain. They come in 14 karat white gold, yellow gold and stainless steel, with removable chains, and their designs include birthstones and diamonds. “I was playing with a chain one day, draping it across my hand between two rings and thought ‘what if we connected these?’” said Christina Senia. “Initially, industry insiders were skeptical, but now, it has become synonymous with our brand. It's fun to spot our Chain Rings on people walking the streets of New York. We were the first to introduce this innovative concept.” Jewelry by Senia Next up, the brand plans on expanding into the engagement ring industry with a patent-pending convertible engagement ring. It turns a ring into a necklace. “Until now, people often had to choose between wearing their symbol of love and engaging in their work,” said Christina Senia. “Love shouldn't hold you back, and neither should your rings.” In this sense, jewelry is finally changing to adapt to the modern woman. “We deserve jewelry that adapts to our lifestyle, not the other way around,” she adds. A portion of all the brand’s sales support various organizations to provide economic opportunities for artists and people experiencing homelessness through their hand sculpted jewelry events. Hornet Huggies earrings by Senia, inspired by the Italian Cornicello Senia notes this shift reaches the traditional bridal world, too. “It's about time the industry evolved to meet the needs of modern, active individuals who want to proudly display their commitment without compromising their professional or personal activities,” said Christina Senia. “This launch is more than just a new product; it's a statement about how we view relationships and individual pursuits in today's world.” The great grandparents of Christina and Gina Senia in Italy.

Seeing five other people arrive, the man who was hitting her stopped, but soon resumed. They restrained him as he struggled to box and kick her. They urged her to give him two slaps, after which they said they would handle him in kind. Which seems to be their system—the victim must deliver the first blow, and then they would beat up the man sufficiently, but avoiding serious injury, so that he would not ever forget the lesson. The woman hesitated and refused. The five stayed for an hour, threatening the man with thrashings and a police complaint, and then left. Riding back to town, they took a 25km detour through the blazing sandscape to go to a police outpost and inform them of the case. This was standard procedure, though they did not expect any action. They rushed again to the woman’s village the next week. Not only had the assailant battered her again, but also his own elderly mother; and he was rounding up goats to sell for money to buy alcohol. They reached her hut in half an hour; there was no sign of the police, whom they had alerted immediately upon receiving the woman’s call.

Soon, he was begging for mercy. The drama was witnessed by most of the neighbours. The team threatened him with direr consequences if he ever struck her or his mother again. Then they left. That man called the leader of this team the day before I met them to report to her that he had been behaving very well, and they should talk to the woman. Which she did, and the woman confirmed that the man had been different for the past five weeks—since the day of his thrashing. Six members of their full team of 20 had come to our meeting. The leader was there, along with two who were involved in that incident; the three others were also veterans of many such skirmishes. Four of this group of six were women—of which three are survivors of acid attacks, among the most heinous acts that women suffer in our country. Our conversation was light-hearted because the women were bubbly. Their bodies bore acid scars, but not their spirit. They seemed to be having fun. Given the easy-going conversation, I could ask them everything directly. Wouldn’t he, like others of his kind, restart beating the woman soon? How long could they keep watch? Couldn’t they tackle this some other way? And they were themselves resorting to violence; wasn’t that wrong? What about the law? And more in the same vein. They described their experience.

Josh Corder Select a question above or ask something else Sharjah, unlike neighboring Dubai, is positioning itself as a center for cultural and sustainable tourism, favoring eco-friendly developments like camps and nature reserves. The emirate's approach to 'invisible' tourism emphasizes genuine experiences and holistic sustainability. Despite being smaller than Dubai's, Sharjah's tourism market is growing, with significant contributions from Russian visitors and an ongoing effort to preserve its cultural heritage. Sharjah, one of the seven emirates in the UAE, is less than an hour from the super-modern Downtown district of Dubai. But unlike Dubai and other emirates, Sharjah is focused on becoming the national center of cultural tourism – it favors tents, camps and eco-resorts over mega-structures. Khawla Al Hashimi, Chief Projects Officer of the Sharjah Investment and Development Authority (Shurooq) said at a Dubai event this month the idea is to be “invisible.” She said: “I’m probably the only architect who will say our goal is to be invisible. Our goal is for the development to be invisible. We step back and we stop saying how many keys a project will have, or if it will have the longest I don’t know what. Once we step back from that [ideology], we can look at genuine experiences.” As a government entity, Shurooq has access to the best plots of land in the emirate, on which it is creating hospitality projects like the Moon Retreat camp and protected nature reserves. Al Hashimi added: “Where Sharjah is most different is in this: We don’t look at sustainability as an added step in a project. We look at it holistically. With the land we have, there are sensitive areas we have to enhance.” While its tourism market is significantly smaller than Dubai’s, Sharjah has seen growth this year. The emirate had just over a million hotel guests through August this year, according to the Sharjah Commerce and Tourism Development Authority. Over those eight months, Russia was the top source market for Sharjah, contributing 21% of all hotel guests, which amounted to around 160,000 visitors. Other major markets included the UAE (11%), India (10%), and Oman (6%). Sharjah is the most conservative of the seven emirates and the only one that still outlaws alcohol. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, which is becoming more and more Western, notably giving the green light for casinos earlier this month. Sharjah discovered oil in the 1970s, leading to a surge in development. Today, leaders are focused on preserving large portions of the emirate through the “Heart of Sharjah” project, aimed at restoring narrow, traditional alleys, souks, and other historic structures. While you could call Sharjah the polar opposite of Dubai just next door, the more modern emirate is also trying to develop more cultural tourism offerings. Issam Kazim, CEO of Dubai Tourism, at the Skift Global Forum 2024 last month that the city will rely less on its famous landmarks and celebrity campaigns, in favor of a more authentic tourism experience. “I think initially Dubai started off… we needed to create enough noise to get attention, we needed landmark projects, 7-star hotels, islands.

[+] fierce debates over scientific ethics, fossil trade, and the global ownership of natural history. Paleontologist David Martill was on a routine trip to Germany with his students in 2012 when he stumbled upon something that would change his life for ever. Martill and his students were at the world-renowned Bürgermeister Müller Museum in Solnhofen. The museum, known for its treasure trove of ancient fossils preserved in limestone slabs, held many specimens, each with its own piece of Earth’s long-forgotten history. As he meandered through the collection, his attention was drawn to a small fossil—just six inches long from nose to tail—labeled merely as an “unknown fossil.” At first glance, it seemed to resemble a snake, its long, slender body coiled in the familiar serpentine shape. But Martill noticed two astonishing details that would send ripples through the scientific world. The fossil of Tetrapodophis amplectus. On the right-hand side, toward the bottom of the image, two ... [+] hind limbs are clearly visible. A closer look toward the top of the picture will also show frontal limbs. The first was the type of rock the fossil was embedded in. It wasn’t just any slab of limestone—it was from Brazil’s Crato Formation, a geological site famous for its exquisite Early Cretaceous fossils, dating back roughly 125 to 113 million years ago. This was strange because fossils from that region are tightly regulated, and their removal from Brazil without government approval has been illegal since 1942. Yet here it was, sitting in a museum in Germany, thousands of miles from its likely origin. Upon closer inspection of the snake-like creature, Martill discovered something else that simply shouldn’t be there—four limbs, all intact. Snakes, with their sleek, elongated bodies, lost their limbs millions of years ago in their evolutionary history. The presence of legs—visible, articulated and unmistakably connected to the fossil—hinted that it was a relic from a time when creatures like it still had vestiges of their lizard ancestry. The fossil, which had likely been smuggled out of Brazil decades earlier, now sat at the heart of a growing storm over scientific ethics, national heritage and the dark underbelly of the fossil trade. Many lizard lineages, like the Cape grass lizard pictured here from southern Africa, have undergone ... [+] significant limb reduction or complete limb loss. However, only one of these evolutionary branches gave rise to the modern snakes we know today. David Martill’s July 2015 study published in the prestigious journal Science, made waves in the paleontological community. Snakes, a highly diverse and successful group today, have long puzzled scientists when it comes to their evolutionary origins. While researchers had discovered snake fossils with two limbs, no fossil had ever shown all four limbs—until Martill and his team’s discovery. The fossil they described—a species belonging to the genus Tetrapodophis—came from Brazil’s Crato Formation and represented an early snake with a long, slender body that still retained small, functional limbs. The species, Tetrapodophis amplectus, was a small, snake-like reptile from the Early Cretaceous period, roughly 110 million years ago. Martill’s study revealed key insights into the transition from lizards to snakes. This four-limbed snake had prehensile limbs that might have been used for grasping prey or during mating. Its body, adapted for burrowing, challenged previous theories suggesting that snakes evolved from marine ancestors. The fossil also showed evidence of hooked teeth and a flexible spine, indicating that it could constrict its prey, pointing to an early shift toward carnivory in snake evolution. The discovery was a significant piece of the puzzle in understanding how early snakes lived and evolved, suggesting that snakes originated in Gondwana, a supercontinent that once included South America, Africa and India. While the scientific significance of the fossil was undeniable, the manner in which it was obtained sparked an international outcry. Brazil has enforced strict fossil protection laws since 1942, designed to preserve the country’s paleontological heritage. These regulations forbid the export of fossils without government authorization, and any research involving them requires the collaboration of Brazilian scientists. The aim is to ensure that Brazil retains control over its valuable natural history, and that local researchers play a key role in studying their country’s fossil records. However, the Tetrapodophis fossil had likely been smuggled out of Brazil decades earlier. When the fossil’s origins came into question, David Martill made headlines not just for the fossil’s discovery, but for his dismissive comments. In a shocking interview, Martill openly stated, “I don’t care a damn how [or when] the fossil came from Brazil,” arguing th.'}, {'title': \"Poland tightens visa rules as probe confirms previous government's cash-for-visas scandal\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/poland-tightens-visa-rules-probe-135141901.html', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': 'Poland is tightening its visa regulations as probes into alleged cash-for-visa scandal have confirmed irregularities under the previous right-wing government...', 'content': \"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland is tightening its visa regulations as probes into alleged cash-for-visa scandal have confirmed irregularities under the previous right-wing government which cost the public purse millions of dollars, the foreign minister of this European Union country said Thursday. Radek Sikorski said it will be much tougher now to obtain a visa for Poland, a document which gives access to unrestricted travel within Europe’s border-free Schengen zone, and the vetting of applicants will be stepped up. For example, student visa applications will be scrutinized to prevent situations in which they were only used as a means of getting into Europe. On Thursday the state Supreme Audit Office released the report of its investigation into the Foreign Ministry visa department and confirmed media allegations made last year that Polish consulates in Asia and Africa took thousands of dollars for each work visa, against regulations. It said it found 46 kinds of irregularities in five different areas, including a lack of transparency, an environment prone to corruption and poor supervision by the minister at the time, Zbigniew Rau. One of the most egregious examples involved visas for dozens of farmers from India, who were described in their documents as Bollywood filmmakers. The ministry lost control over the visa system, especially in the years 2018-2023, Sikorski told a news conference. “We can confirm that, unfortunately, in a scandalous way, unlawful pressure was exercised over Polish consuls with the intention of increasing the number of visas issued to people ... who should not necessarily obtain them, including the citizens of the Russian Federation,” Sikorski said. He said the ministry was contributing to the process of drawing up Poland's new policy for curbing illegal migration, which Prime Minister Donald Tusk is to present on Saturday. Earlier this year, Sikorski's initial reaction to the scandal was to hike visa fees, which used to be among Europe’s cheapest and attracted migrants from Asia and Africa seeking access to Europe via Poland. The cash-for-visa system was developed under the previous government of Law and Justice, in stark contrast to its anti-migrant policies and statements. The report released Thursday said that between 2018 and early 2024, thousands of visas were issued to people who paid hefty sums to agencies cooperating with Polish consulates. One agency alone issued more than 4,200 visas between Jan. 1, 2018 and March 29, 2024. Some applicants paid as much as 30,000 zlotys ($7,600; euro 7,000), according to the auditors. The audit chamber is weighing whether to take the case to prosecutors. Based on a separate investigation by the state anti-corruption bureau, prosecutors have so far charged former deputy foreign minister, Piotr Wawrzyk, and nine other people, and are continuing their probe. A special parliamentary commission that was formed after elections last fall is also probing the visa irregularities, and its conclusions so far have confirmed many flaws in the system. The audit chamber said that, on the whole, between 2018 and 2023, Poland issued 6.1 million visas, including 1.2 million Schengen visas, out of 6.5 million applications. Some 3.4 million visas were granted to Ukrainian citizens, 1.6 million to Belarusians and more than 357,000 to Russia's citizens, some after Russia's aggression against Ukraine in February 2022.

He was 86. His death was announced in a statement by Tata Group Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran, who called Tata “a truly uncommon leader whose immeasurable contributions have shaped not only the Tata Group but also the very fabric of our nation.” As chairman for more than two decades beginning in 1991, Tata rapidly expanded the 156-year-old business house. It now has operations in more than 100 countries and clocked $165 billion in revenue for the year ended March 2024. Through more than two dozen listed firms, the conglomerate makes products ranging from coffee and cars to salt and software, runs airlines and introduced India’s first superapp. It has also partnered with Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. for a $11 billion chip fabrication plant in India and is said to be planning an iPhone assembly plant. Under Tata’s stewardship, the conglomerate embarked on an expansion drive that turned the tables on India’s colonial past. It snapped up iconic British assets including steelmaker Corus Group Plc. in 2007 and luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover in 2008. But the financial crisis roiled global markets soon after, damping car sales in developed economies. “Ratan Tata imagined big and took the empire beyond India,” said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director of the Thomas Schmidheiny Center for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. “While he thought globally, these turned out to be hasty initiatives.” Tata helmed the group for 21 years in his first stint and retired in 2012. He returned as interim chief for a few months in 2016 following the acrimonious ouster of his successor, Cyrus Mistry. Tata also found himself at the center of intense battles for control of the conglomerate not once but twice in his career. The first battle, when he took over as chairman in 1991, pitted him against long-time executives who had been running fiefdoms within the conglomerate under his predecessor. The second, in 2016—four years after his retirement—was about preserving his legacy as Mistry sought to reduce debt. Tata won both. In 2016, Mistry was ousted as the chairman of Tata Sons, the group’s main holding firm, in a boardroom coup. The move triggered a bitter courtroom battle that threatened to end a 70-year partnership with Mistry’s family and stamped Tata’s authority on the conglomerate. In 2020, Mistry’s family signaled its intent to sell an 18% stake in Tata Sons. The conglomerate faced another crisis in late 2008 when terrorists targeted the group’s flagship hotel, the Taj Mahal Palace, overlooking Mumbai’s Gateway of India, part of a broader attack on the city. About 31 people, including 11 employees, died during the four-day siege. Guests staying at the hotel today are greeted by a memorial with the names of the victims, each of whose families Tata personally visited. Tata never married and had no children. His death leaves a vacuum at the helm of the powerful Tata Trusts, a collective of charities. These philanthropic trusts own about 66% of Tata Sons, which in turn controls all the major listed Tata firms. Tata Trusts have traditionally been led by a member of the Tata family and wields control over the conglomerate through its holding in Tata Sons. In his last few years, Tata became a passionate backer of startups including Ola Electric Mobility Ltd., which had a bumper listing in 2024, and Goodfellows, a platform aimed at intergenerational friendships. The origins of the Tata group date back to 1868, when Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata set up a trading company that later diversified into cotton mills, steel plants and hotels. The Tatas belong to the Parsi Zoroastrian community, which fled religious persecution in Persia centuries ago before finding refuge in western India. Born in Mumbai on Dec. 28, 1937, Ratan Naval Tata was brought up by his grandmother after his parents, Naval and Sooni Tata, divorced when he was 10. His father had been adopted into the main Tata family at 13 by the daughter-in-law of Jamsetji Tata, founder of the Tata Group. Usually chauffeured around in a Rolls-Royce, Tata attended school in India’s business capital, Mumbai. As a young student, he learned the piano and played cricket but was afraid of public speaking. His younger brother, Jimmy Tata, stayed out of public life, and little is known about him. “We faced a fair bit of ragging and personal discomfort because of our parent’s divorce, which in those days wasn’t as common as it is today,” Ratan Tata wrote in a Facebook post in 2020. “But our grandmother taught us to retain dignity at all costs, a value that’s stayed with me until today. It involved walking away from these situations, which otherwise we would have fought back against.” Tata went to college in the US at Cornell University with plans to study mechanical engineer.'}, {'title': 'Europe and the Polycrisis', 'link': 'https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/eu-must-respond-to-polycrisis-with-institutional-transformation-by-thomas-buberl-1-2024-10', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': 'While the European Union may be the most in need of an institutional transformation to respond to today’s polycrisis, it is also particularly well equipped to execute one.

Business leaders, politicians and celebrities were among thousands of people who paid their last respects at the centre where his body lay in state before being cremated. Maharashtra state declared a day of mourning and his coffin was given a military salute as it was taken away for the funeral rites. Ratan Tata took over as group chairman in 1991 and is credited with transforming it into a global powerhouse. Thousands turned up at the National Centre for Performing Arts in Mumbai, where Ratan Tata’s body was taken in the morning, to pay their respects. His casket was wrapped in the Indian flag and covered with wreaths of white flowers. Fellow business tycoon Mukesh Ambani, Home Minister Amit Shah and Bollywood star Aamir Khan were among those present to say goodbye. Also in attendance was Ratan Tata\\'s dog, Goa, accompanied by two Tata employees. The dog was rescued from the streets of Goa state, which gave it its name. The tycoon, who had a reputation for being modest and shy, was known for his philanthropic work, including animal welfare, health and education. Tata\\'s death was announced on Wednesday night. He had been admitted to hospital earlier in the week. \"His legacy will continue to inspire us as we strive to uphold the principles he so passionately championed,\" a company statement said. The Tata Group is one of India\\'s largest companies, with annual revenues in excess of $100bn (£76.5bn), and he was one of India\\'s most internationally-recognised business leaders. Founded 155 years ago, the group straddles a business empire ranging from Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel, to aviation and salt pans. During his 20-year tenure, the conglomerate made several high-profile acquisitions, including the takeover of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus, UK-based car brands Jaguar and Land Rover, and Tetley, the world\\'s second-largest tea company. Some of those decisions paid off, while others - including a failed telecom venture and the Nano, which was billed as the world\\'s cheapest car but flopped - lost money. Tata was born in a traditional Parsi family in 1937. He studied architecture and structural engineering at Cornell University in the US. In 1962, he joined Tata Industries - the promoter company of the group - as an assistant and spent six months training at a company plant in Jamshedpur. From there, he went on to work at the Tata Iron and Steel Company (now Tata Steel), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and National Radio and Electronics (Nelco). In 1991, JRD Tata, who had led the group for over half a century, appointed Ratan Tata as his successor. \"He [JRD Tata] was my greatest mentor... he was like a father and a brother to me - and not enough has been said about that,\" Tata later told an interviewer. In 2008, the Indian government awarded him the Padma Vibhushan, the country\\'s second-highest civilian honour. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed Tata as a \"visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being\".

Stating that the platform is one of the pillars of the government’s Rs 10,000 crore IndiaAI Mission, Kumarum said the goal is to create a space for developers to create, train, and deploy their own models. “The idea primarily is like HuggingFace – you have models, you have datasets, and you have people coming up and using those datasets and building models. We are trying to do something similar,” Kumarum said, as per the report. Data from central and state governments, as well as from the private sector, will be part of the platform. Last month, Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and CEO of Digital India Corporation, Abhishek Singh, informed that the Indian government, under the IndiaAI Dataset Platform, was setting up Data Management Offices which would be tasked with ensuring that data collected is AI-usable. Additionally, there would be corresponding Data Management Units in every government department, he mentioned.

Private companies have also announced LLMs trained in Indic languages. Tech Mahindra’s ‘Project Indus’, initially trained in Hindi and around 37 dialects, claimed that it would cover other languages and dialects in a phased manner. Ola in December 2023 announced Krutrim, a family of LLMs trained in Indian languages, to cater to “1.4 billion India.” Krutrim claimed to be similar to ChatGPT in reasoning capabilities and that its base model could write in 10 Indian languages while understanding 20.

Early reviews are Barbie-tastic.', 'content': 'By Kamala Thiagarajan This Diwali Barbie was released on Oct. 4 — and has already sold out on Mattel\\'s website. Does the doll reflect a different view of beauty, as Mattel claims — an Indian view? Rafael Ortega / Mattel Inc. hide caption This fall, a new Barbie entered the Barbieverse. She’s got a very long name -- “Barbie Signature Diwali Doll By Anita Dongre Wearing Festival Of Lights Look.” (Dongre is a noted Indian fashion designer who collaborated with Mattel on the doll.) And a kinda long – and controversial -- back story, too. You see, Diwali Barbie is not the first Indian Barbie. The first was launched in 1996 and known simply as Indian Barbie.’ Dressed in a gaudy pink saree, she came packaged with a lot of misinformation. An inauthentic description of Indian culture was written onto her box — from the description of a saree as a ‘two piece outfit with a shawl’ (sarees don’t have shawls) to the declaration that Indians “never ate with forks or knives” because they enjoyed eating with their hands In 2012, another version of Barbie in india appeared, dressed in what appeared to be a yellow saree; she was packaged with her own “playful monkey friend.” Over the years, doll after doll was launched during the festive season of Diwali in India (which starts in late October or early November). They wore traditional Indian clothing but little else about these Indian Barbies indicated that they were … well, Indian. Critics said that the skin tone of these earlier Barbies was too pale compared to the brown skin tones in India and that her features were a cookie cutter of the American Barbie: rounded face, blue eyes, upturned button nose. And she wasn’t very popular with Indian kids. Priti Nemani, an Indian-American attorney living in Chicago, analyzed why Barbie failed so spectacularly in her research paper “A case study on the failure of the Barbie doll in the Indian Market,” published in the Asia Pacific Law and Policy Journal in 2011. She says that Mattel “repackages Barbie in a variety of ethnicities” making “superficial ethnic and racial modifications to the doll,” which in the case of Indian consumers, just didn’t work. And there was another factor. \"Indian kids gravitated toward the white-skinned Barbie because light-skinned women were considered more beautiful in India,\" says ElsaMarie DSilva, a social entrepreneur from India and an Aspen fellow — referring to the colorism that has characterized Indian society. Flash forward to October 4, 2024 — the day Diwali Barbie went on sale. “Barbie used to be a more singular reflection of beauty and more one-dimensional,” Mattel’s executive vice president and chief brand officer, Lisa McKnight, told Reuters. “Today, there are many Barbies, and we’ve got multiple views of the brand.” So does this Barbie reflect a different view of beauty — an Indian view? For starters, the doll’s skin is darker than earlier India Barbies — although not as dark as the skin tones of many Indians. Her eyes and hair are dark as well. Doll co-designer Dongre wrote that her Barbie represents the “fashion forward modern woman who wears India on her sleeve with pride” -- sporting kohl-rimmed eyes, the traditional dangling bell-shaped earrings called jhumkas and a bunch of gold bangles. She’s abandoned the more traditional saree for a fashionable lehenga or an ankle length skirt, cropped blouse and vest in deep blue and gold with floral motifs from the northern Indian state of Rajasthan. This new Indian Barbie is a big hit. The $40 doll sold out on Mattel’s website in 24 hours. Sales figures in India have not been released. But there are lots of opinions. Barbie’s self-proclaimed superfan is happy. Vichitra Rajasingh of Madurai , who once amassed a collection of 80 Barbies, says she loves the Diwali doll: “The launch of the new Barbie in India is a refreshing departure from the cliched versions we\\'ve seen before. I\\'ve never owned an Indian Barbie before because the earlier versions with their fair skin and gaudy, stereotypical Indian attire never appealed to me. But I\\'d definitely buy this one! Everything, from the skin tone to the fashion is on point.\" Atlanta-based cookbook author Nandita Godbole, 53, who spent her early years in Mumbai, says that a doll like Diwali Barbie would have been very helpful when her daughter was growing up. She remembers taking her to dance classes and arguing with the teachers about how their routine make-up palette just wasn’t suited for darker skin tones. “Darker skinned girls were often sent to the back row,” she says. Jeniffer Grace is another admirer of the new doll.

One post (archived) on X featuring a short clip and three still images, garnered over 2.5 million views, reading: \"The power of nature. That\\'s Milton Category 5.\" (X user @ShortReportOnX) Some viewers were skeptical of the authenticity of the images. \"I really don\\'t think this is nature,\" one X user commented, while another one claimed the footage was computer generated. Another X post (archived), with the video and one of the photographs, captioned them: \"A spectacular satellite image of a once-in-a-generation super hurricane,\" reaching over 528,200 views. The clip and images were spread on multiple social media platforms, including Instagram, X, Threads, and TikTok. Only one of the four images genuinely showed Hurricane Milton from space. For that reason, we have rated this claim a mixture of fact and fiction. Let\\'s look at them one-by-one. For convenience, the images and video clip are numbered 1 through 4, as shown below: (X user @ShortReportOnX) The first item attached to the viral post was a short, two-second clip. Google reverse image search results showed it was spread by multiple social media users and news outlets, such as The Times of India and the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. The video clip was authentic and was originally shared by Sen, a U.K. startup that sent its ultra-high-definition cameras to the International Space Station (ISS). Sen\\'s X post featuring the video read: \"Timelapse from our cameras on the International Space Station (ISS) shows the eye of Hurricane Milton.\" The video was also uploaded to Sen\\'s TikTok account and YouTube channel with a caption reading, \"Hurricane Milton filmed from space as it travels across the Gulf of Mexico on 08 October 2024.\" The full footage was also available via Sen\\'s official website. (www.sen.com) The second and third images in the post were authentic but depicted the 2015 Typhoon Maysak, not Hurricane Milton. TinEye results showed the second photo was circulating at least since 2022; however, its full version was available online since 2015. Alarmy.com, a stock photo website, captioned it, \"Maysak seen from the ISS 2\" and noted \"NASA Image Collection\" as a contributor. The original photograph was captured by NASA astronaut Terry Virts and originally shared on Apr. 1, 2015, on the Facebook page of International Space Station. (International Space Station Facebook page) The original image was flipped 90 degrees and slightly cropped (see image below): (X user @ShortReportOnX, International Space Station Facebook page) TinEye results indicated the third image had circulated online at least since early April 2015. Similarly, it showed Typhoon Maysak and was captured on March 31, 2015, and published on NASA\\'s website on Apr. 1, 2015. (NASA.gov) Its caption said it showed Typhoon Maysak and European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti captured it while flying over the weather system onboard the International Space Station. The photograph was also shared by the website of NASA Earth Observatory. In this case, the original image was flipped 180 degrees and cropped, as illustrated in the comparison below (with the cropped image on the left and the original on the right): (X user @ShortReportOnX, NASA.gov) Below you can see more photographs of Typhoon Mysak shared by Cristoforetti via her X account in early April 2015: Finally, a TinEye reverse image search revealed that the fourth image has been circulating online since at least 2023. As a result, it cannot depict Hurricane Milton in October 2024. The photo was available on the Adobe Stock website with a caption in German reading, \"A hurricane over the sea.\" Moreover, the image was one of a series, three of which were labeled as AI-generated (you can see them below). (Adobe Stock) In sum, the fourth image showed signs of being artificially created (with unnatural colors, particularly in the hurricane\\'s eye), lacking the realistic gradients typically found in nature, and having an overly polished appearance. Moreover, no reputable media outlets had shared or verified the image. Hive and AI or Not tools for also concluded the image was \"likely AI generated.\" Similarly, TrueMedia.org website found \"substantial evidence of manipulation\" in the image. (Hive) Below you can find some authentic photographs of Hurricane Milton shared by the International Space Station on Oct. 9, 2024: Hurricane Milton is pictured as a Category 5 storm in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Yucatan Peninsula from the space station on Oct. 8, 2024.

In the report released Wednesday, less than a month before the U.S. presidential election, the company claims to have neutralized \"more than 20 operations and deceptive networks from around the world that attempted to use our models.\" It noted that there were no significant breakthroughs in the criminals\\' \"ability to develop new malware or build large viral audiences,\" the report pointed out. It highlighted that most of the social media content was focused on the elections in the U.S. and Rwanda, with lesser attention on elections in India and the European Union. However, none of the election-related operations managed to achieve \"viral engagement\" or build \"sustained audiences\" via the use of ChatGPT and OpenAI\\'s other tools, the report stated. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has also raised alarms about a growing threat from Russia, Iran, and China attempting to influence the Nov. 5 presidential election via AI tools that spread fake or divisive information.

However, it failed to gain audience engagement. Similarly, in July, OpenAI banned ChatGPT accounts in Rwanda for posting election-related comments on X. In May, an Israeli company used ChatGPT to generate social media comments about elections in India. Additionally, in June, OpenAI uncovered a covert operation that used its products to create comments on European Parliament elections in France and on politics in the U.S., Germany, Italy, and Poland.

Tata has been a mythical name in Indian consumers\\' imaginations for generations. Every day, all across India, people consume the Tata Group\\'s salt and lentils, commute to work on Tata buses passing Tata cars and trucks after applying Tata beauty products in homes built from Tata steel. In Kashmir, Firdosa Jan makes tea for her family from a packet labeled Tata Tea Gold. Hundreds of miles away in the northeastern Indian state of Nagaland, 25-year-old Teisovinuo Yhome is cooking a dish on an open fire, using Tata salt for seasoning. Even though it was a business conglomerate, in the popular imagination, Tata was a man to envy and emulate. At the turn of the 20th century, Ratan Tata’s grandfather, Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, built the first luxury hotel in India, and many saw it as better than any the British rulers had built in the country. His uncle JRD Tata started the first airline in the country, and it earned praise for its service and punctuality. Tata was socially conscious before corporate social responsibility became a buzzword for businesses. The group was the first to introduce early employee benefit programs for its workers in 1896. It built a hospital in Jamshedpur, before starting a steel mill there. In 1892, it established an endowment fund for Indian students seeking to pursue higher studies abroad and in 1909 founded the Indian Institute of Science, now a public research university. With time its legend has only grown. In 2008, the company grabbed headlines with its “People\\'s Car,\" the Tata Nano. The car cost about $2,000 at its launch. In the same year, Tata acquired the iconic British brands of Jaguar and Land Rover. Its product portfolio boasts dozens of brands. The ubiquitous Tata cars, watches, air conditioners, soaps, salt and tea are only a fraction of what the group produces or markets. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.'}, {'title': 'Ratan Tata, who put India’s Tata Group on the global map, dies at 86', 'link': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ratan-tata-put-indias-tata-group-global-map-dies-86-rcna174802', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': 'Ratan Tata, the former Tata Group chairman who put a staid and sprawling Indian conglomerate on the global stage with a string of high-profile acquisitions, has died, the Tata Group said in a statement late on Wednesday.', 'content': 'Ratan Tata, the former Tata Group chairman who put a staid and sprawling Indian conglomerate on the global stage with a string of high-profile acquisitions, has died, the Tata Group said in a statement late on Wednesday. He was 86 and ran the conglomerate for more than 20 years as chairman. \"It is with a profound sense of loss that we bid farewell to Mr. Ratan Naval Tata, a truly uncommon leader whose immeasurable contributions have shaped not only the Tata Group but also the very fabric of our nation,\" the company said. Ratan Tata \"was a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being,\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on social media platform X. \"Extremely pained by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family, friends and admirers in this sad hour.\" After graduating with a degree in architecture at Cornell University, he returned to India and in 1962 began working for the group his great-grandfather had founded nearly a century earlier. He worked in several Tata companies, including Telco, now Tata Motors Ltd, as well as Tata Steel Ltd, later making his mark by erasing losses and increasing market share at group unit National Radio & Electronics Company. In 1991, he took the helm of the conglomerate when his uncle J.R.D. Tata stepped down — the passing of the baton coming just as India embarked on radical reforms that opened up its economy to the world and ushered in an era of high growth. In one of his first steps, Ratan Tata sought to rein in the power of some heads of Tata Group\\'s companies, enforcing retirement ages, promoting younger people to senior positions and ramping up control over companies. He founded telecommunications firm Tata Teleservices in 1996 and took IT firm Tata Consultancy Services, the group\\'s cash cow, public in 2004. But to grow properly, the group determined it needed to look beyond Indian shores. It \"was the quest for growth and changing the ground rules to say that we could grow by acquisitions which earlier we had never done,\" he said in an interview with the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 2013. The group purchased British tea firm Tetley in 2000 for $432 million and Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus in 2007 for $13 billion, at the time the biggest takeover of a foreign firm by an Indian company. Tata Motors then acquired British luxury auto brands Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motor Co in 2008 for $2.3 billion. His pet projects at Tata Motors included the Indica — the first car model designed and built in India — as well as the Nano, touted as the world’s cheapest car. He contributed initial sketches for both models. The Indica was a commercial success. The Nano, however, priced at just 100,000 rupees (about $1,200) and the culmination of Ratan Tata\\'s dream to produce an affordable car for India\\'s masses, was hurt by initial safety issues and bungled marketing. It was discontinued a decade after its launch. A licensed pilot who would occasionally fly the company plane, Ratan Tata never married and was known for his quiet demeanor, relatively modest lifestyle and philanthropic work. About two-thirds of share capital of Tata Sons, the group\\'s holding company, is held by philanthropic trusts. His leadership at Tata was not without controversy — most notably a bitter public feud after the company ousted Cyrus Mistry, a scion of the billionaire Shapoorji Pallonji clan, as chairman of Tata Sons in 2016. The Tata Group said Mistry had failed to turnaround poorly performing businesses while Mistry accused Ratan Tata, who was chairman emeritus of the conglomerate, of interfering and creating an alternate power center at the group. After he stepped back from the Tata Group, Ratan Tata became known as a prominent investor in Indian startups, backing a plethora of companies including digital payments firm Paytm, Ola Electric, a unit of ride hailing firm Ola, and home and beauty services provider Urban Company. Among his many awards, he received the Padma Vibhushan, India’s second highest civilian honor, in 2008 for exceptional and distinguished service in trade and industry.

In Asia-Pacific, that means handling the surge in visitors while keeping it sustainable, nailing targeted marketing, and leveling out those seasonal travel waves. Peden Doma Bhutia Select a question above or ask something else In 2024, the Asia-Pacific region is at the forefront of the global tourism recovery, experiencing a 19% increase in international arrivals. Key markets such as China, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia are contributing significantly to this growth, although they are still striving to meet pre-pandemic levels. Emerging travel trends include a focus on sustainability and improved seasonality planning, as destinations seek to manage the resurgence in tourism while addressing environmental concerns and optimizing visitor distribution throughout the year. The global tourism industry is bouncing back in 2024. International arrivals increased 16% between January and August, compared to 2023, according to travel intelligence firm ForwardKeys. The company’s insights, presented at the World Travel and Tourism Council’s (WTTC) Global Summit in Perth, highlighted the pivotal role of the Asia-Pacific region in driving this resurgence. Despite ongoing challenges, pent-up demand is leading to rapid growth across several key markets. Travel is surging globally, however, Asia-Pacific (APAC) has emerged as a key engine of growth. The region’s recovery was slower compared to other parts of the world, largely due to delayed reopening after the pandemic. But the catch-up phase is in full swing. In 2024, APAC is experiencing double-digit growth, with international arrivals projected to rise by 19% overall. China, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia are leading the charge, each showing significant year-on-year growth in visitor numbers. “Asia is still in a recovery phase, catching up with its 2019 levels,” Olivier Ponti, director of intelligence and marketing at ForwardKeys, said on Wednesday. “But we are seeing consistent progress, especially in countries like China, which still has space to grow. Malaysia, Japan, Indonesia and Vietnam are also growing strong.” This recovery trajectory, though promising, indicates a gap between current performance and pre-pandemic benchmarks. However, the year’s upward trend has industry stakeholders optimistic that the region will continue to close the gap through the end of 2024 and beyond. Within Asia-Pacific, different markets are recovering at varying speeds. Southeast Asia and South Asia have shown robust growth, especially when compared to last year. However, when benchmarking against 2019 levels, South Asia is the strongest performer, thanks to countries like India, which initiated recovery efforts early in 2023. Oceania has seen a 10% increase in arrivals, driven largely by New Zealand and Australia. The resurgence of international tourism is not just about where people are going, but where they’re coming from. ForwardKeys highlighted that the U.S. and European markets are already in growth mode, while China and Japan’s outbound travel are still recovering, albeit with strong year-on-year improvements. “China and Japan are both showing substantial growth compared with last year, but they still haven’t reached 2019 levels,” said Ponti. This trend offers destinations opportunities to focus on re-engaging these critical markets as they return to international travel. A key takeaway for destinations aiming to attract Chinese travelers is the need for targeted strategies. The Golden Week travel period in October saw Chinese visitors surpassing 2019 levels in Asian markets like Macau, Singapore and Hong Kong , reflecting the potential for a swift rebound if destinations adapt their marketing and engagement efforts. Beyond Asia, Chinese outbound travel to destinations like Istanbul, London, Moscow, Milan and Dubai during the October Golden week also exceeded pre pandemic levels, Ponti noted. In addition to recovery numbers, sustainability emerged as a major theme during the ForwardKeys’ presentation. The aviation industry is taking steps toward a greener future, with airlines investing in new-generation, fuel-efficient aircraft. However, destinations still grapple with integrating sustainable practices into their tourism models, Ponti said. The shift towards sustainable practices is not only driven by regulatory pressures but also by changing traveler preferences. Another challenge highlighted was managing tourism growth through better seasonality planning. Unlike pre-pandemic times, travel demand today is more evenly spread across the year, offering destinations a chance to balance visitor numbers and reduce peak-season strains. Japan, for example, has made progress in extending its tourist season by promoting lesser-known attractions during off-peak months.

Investors in Asia enter the final trading day of the week with sentiment dented a bit by surprisingly sticky U.S. inflation the day before, and with a sense of caution ahead of keenly-awaited news on China's stimulus plans from Beijing the following day. Wall Street only posted mild losses on Thursday, the downside perhaps cushioned by soft weekly jobless claims figures that would suggest the Fed remains on track to cut interest rates a further 50 basis points this year. Asia will struggle to get much of a steer from Treasuries or the dollar either - the greenback ended flat on Thursday, and yields were mixed across the curve in narrow ranges. Traders have scaled back their expectations of Fed rate cuts since last week's stellar U.S. employment report, but are not quite at the point of pricing in a pause in the cycle. Yet that's what Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic floated on Thursday. Could incoming data really lead to a skip soon? The highlight in Asia's calendar on Friday is the Bank of Korea's interest rate decision. Economists expect the BOK to deliver its first interest rate cut since the pandemic, kicking off the easing cycle with a 25 basis point cut to 3.25%. All but three of the 37 economists in a Reuters poll expect that from the BOK, and the rest said they expect no change. Analysts generally expect the BOK to move more slowly than its regional peers in the coming months. Inflation eased rapidly to 1.6% in September from 2% in August, the lowest since early 2021 and below the BOK's 2% target, but household debt and property prices are high. Indian trade data, industrial output figures from Malaysia and New Zealand's manufacturing purchasing managers index for September make up the rest of the region's calendar on Friday. New Zealand's manufacturing activity has been shrinking every month since March last year, the PMIs show, although the pace of contraction has slowed sharply the last two months. This release comes days after the country's central bank cut interest rates by half a percentage point and signaled that further easing will follow. Looking ahead to Saturday, all eyes will be on Beijing, where China's finance ministry will detail plans on fiscal stimulus to boost the economy. It is unclear whether this means fresh fiscal steps to revive growth will be taken, or that the package of measures announced recently will be explained in greater detail. Hope, if not expectation, is building that it's the former. If it's the latter, investors are likely to be disappointed and there's a good chance that the stunning rally in Chinese stocks over the last two weeks reverses on Monday, perhaps significantly. Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Friday: - South Korea interest rate decision - India trade (September) - New Zealand manufacturing PMI (September) (Reporting by Jamie McGeever, editing by Deepa Babington) Sign in to access your portfolio.\"}, {'title': '‘Navy docking not a threat’', 'link': 'https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/10/11/navy-docking-not-a-threat', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': 'PUTRAJAYA: The docking of two Chinese naval ships at Penang Port is not a threat to national sovereignty, said Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil. Read full story', 'content': 'Friday, 11 Oct 2024 PUTRAJAYA: The docking of two Chinese naval ships at Penang Port is not a threat to national sovereignty, said Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil. The unity government’s spokesperson explained that warships from other countries often dock at Malaysian ports, but all are done in accordance with protocols set by Wisma Putra and with the knowledge of the Defence Ministry. “It’s true that from time to time, warships from Australia, the United States, China, and even India will dock (at our ports). They are often en route to another destination and will dock here for only a few days. “During the ships’ docking period, the embassy or foreign representatives of the respective countries usually reach out to conduct activities to strengthen the ties between the two nations,” he told reporters after his ministry’s monthly assembly here yesterday, Bernama reported. Fahmi said he regretted attempts by some netizens to invoke racial sentiments and hatred on the issue. “Since 2010, I’ve noticed that every time foreign warships dock, certain netizens would publish untrue claims, even though these ships often engage in social activities to strengthen bilateral ties. “We have good diplomatic relations with many countries, and when their warships dock temporarily at Malaysian ports, they often do so according to protocols,” he said, adding that the police and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission are looking into this matter and will take action against the netizens involved. Penang tourism and creative economy committee chairman Wong Hon Wai has said that there should be no speculation over the visit of two Chinese navy vessels to Penang last weekend as it was done through official channels. He said it was a goodwill visit that included students from China’s Naval University of Engineering and refuted claims otherwise on social media. Following the visit, Bersatu International Bureau chairman Datuk Seri Saifuddin Abdullah, who is Indera Mahkota MP and a former foreign minister, issued a statement yesterday to call out the “exuberant reception” given to the two naval ships, saying that it came when there were allegations of Chinese assets encroaching on Malaysian waters in Sabah and Sarawak.

ARUNO A SOCIAL media account featuring the image of the individual known as “Hot Daddy” has sparked controversy after it became active on X (formerly Twitter), promoting escort and sexual services, Kosmo! reported. A check by the Malay daily showed that the account, which was created in January 2022 using the profile picture of Hot Daddy, has more than 116,000 followers. The account provides links to join a private Telegram group, with those interested having to pay RM150. Various teasers of lewd and sexual videos can be seen showing the faces of Hot Daddy, sparking a wave of reaction online. Several users urged the authorities to have the account removed. On Monday, the Sessions Court issued an arrest warrant for Hasli Ikhwan Arif Zul Hasli, known as Hot Daddy, after he failed to appear in court. The 32-year-old was scheduled to appear before judge Siti Shakirah Mohtarudin for a mention related to his charges of solicitation of prostitution. Arrest warrants were also issued for Hasli Ikhwan’s companions, Norshazrina Md Zamri, 27, and Norhidayah Mahadi, 24. Their names were repeatedly called when proceedings began at 9am, leading the judge to postpone the case until 11am. When the session resumed, the three accused and their bailors were still absent, prompting deputy public prosecutor Mohamad Shahrizzat Amadan to request the arrest warrants. In a separate case, Sessions Court judge Suzana Hussin issued an arrest warrant against Norshazrina, charged under the Film Censorship Act 2002. Both courts set Nov 8 for the next mention of the cases. > A man from Temerloh, Pahang, has set off on a cycling journey to Mecca with a group of friends to perform the umrah pilgrimage, reported Sinar Harian. The journey is expected to take six months, with the group having to traverse more than five countries: Thailand, India, Pakistan, Iran, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Ahmad Zulkifle Ahmad, 56, said he had been planning the trip since last year and was pleased to have finally started on his journey. He added that his close friends, Dahlan Yahya, 71, and two others from Kuala Lumpur, would also be participating. Asked about the cost of his trip, Ahmad Zulkifle said he had allocated about RM10,000 and thanked those who had donated to this trip. “I am also thankful that I have the full support of my wife, Faridah Musa, 58, and my family,” he added.

An indifferent student, he ditched his books to wander around downtown and spotted a “going steady” ring in a jewelry store window that he thought might win over a particular girl. He persuaded the store owner to sell him the $39.99 ring, which succeeded in charming the young lady, for $5 down and $5 a week. “I’ve always been somewhat of a romantic,” he confides. Yet sentiment has little to do with how Stuller, now 73, has become America’s wholesale jewelry king, with a net worth that Forbes estimates at more than $1 billion. Instead, he has built his fortune through a relentless focus on manufacturing processes, logistics and satisfying his retailer customers’ every need. Photo by Cody Pickens for Forbes Stuller met that $5 weekly nut by delivering papers, mowing lawns and washing cars. He showed up every Saturday at 10 a.m. at the jewelry store to make his payment, then hung around to help. “They always needed their windows cleaned,” he recalls. Before long, he had a paid part-time job at the shop, where the bench jeweler taught him how to polish jewelry, size rings and set stones. “I loved it,” he says. By his senior year of high school, Stuller was holing up late at night in the janitor’s closet at his father’s dental practice, repairing jewelry and experimenting with lost-wax casting (used by dentists to produce bridges and crowns) to fabricate missing parts like clasps and links. He still needed to buy certain items. Yet when he called the big distributors, he found them rude. “It was like you were interrupting their day. ‘What do you want?’ ” Matt Stuller guards coils of gold alloy produced from gold bars and other metals in 1,000-degree hydrogen-burning ovens at his Louisiana factory. Stuller knew he could do it better. So after graduating 68th in a high school class of 69 and enduring one semester at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, he dropped out to start selling wholesale to bench jewelers out of the back of his new 1970 Datsun 240Z. “Originally it was just strictly gold parts, because that’s all I could make,” he says. Soon after, he found a jewelry company in New Orleans that was going out of business and bought its inventory and rolling display cases with a postdated check for $4,500, which he barely covered with a loan from a local bank at which, not coincidentally, his father was a big customer. A few years later, when his dad retired, Stuller bought his dental offices to house his ever-expanding collection of equipment, including ovens, polishing devices and a centrifugal casting machine. His dad also helped with a key piece of advice: Never take on a partner. “You will outwork a partner,” his father reasoned. So why share equity? Today, a half-century later, Stuller’s eponymously named, still 100%-family-owned company remains headquartered in Lafayette, where it has its biggest production complex: 600,000 square feet of laboratories, manufacturing and packaging, employing 1,500 workers. Add in production from smaller plants in Mexico, Thailand and India, and Stuller fulfills an average 6,000 orders a day including nearly 130,000 items, some sourced from other manufacturers. A primary ingredient: gold bars. Stuller melts enough to make more than 200 pounds per day of gold alloys for casting. The company books about $800 million in annual sales and throws off $80 million to $100 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda), Stuller says. Forbes estimates it’s worth at least $800 million. (The remainder of his fortune comes from the profits he has taken out of the operation.) Stuller’s website highlights his wide range of products: jewelers’ tools, unmounted gemstones, engagement rings, bespoke bracelets. He says every jewelry retailer buys from him, even Tif\\xadfany, Harry Winston and Cartier. His biggest client is Signet Jewelers, the parent company of mall-based giants Kay Jewelers, Zales and Jared. His secret sauce? Logistics. For years, Stuller personally hauled hundreds of tiny boxes to the post office. Then he started putting couriers on Greyhound buses. In 1981, he had a eureka moment when he met Fred Smith, founder and CEO of then-10-year-old FedEx. Today dedicated FedEx and UPS jets sit on the tarmac at the Lafayette airport waiting until Stuller’s last-minute packages get loaded at 8 p.m. If customers in the continental U.S. place orders by 5 p.m. their time, Stuller guarantees they’ll receive the items the next morning, provided they’re not custom-made. “I just get the greatest pleasure every day by shipping stuff on time,” he says. It’s a big relief for retailers, too, who don’t have to carry lots of (very expensive) inventory. “They can get rid of all their tackle boxes and trays for all the finger sizes. I will sell them anything they want,” Stuller says.

However, Easwaran, the prolific run-scorer for Bengal in domestic cricket, is still waiting for the elusive Test cap. As the Ranji Trophy begins on October 11, India\\'s search for a back-up opener for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy will intensify, especially with its selection on the horizon. Despite an impressive record of 7506 runs in 98 first-class games at an average of 47.65 coming in over a decade, Easwaran\\'s desire to represent India in Tests remains rock-solid. \"I want to stay in the present, but that is not really easy at times. But again, you just remind yourself as to what is there in your control. I try and focus on one day at a time. The dream has always been to play for the country. \"You always want to be in that squad, play for the country, and win games for India. That is always the dream. But that is going to happen when it has to happen. For now, I just want to focus on Ranji Trophy and make sure I do well for Bengal,\" says Easwaran in an exclusive conversation with IANS. Following his successful recovery from a left hamstring injury, Easwaran made scores of 13 and 4 in first round of the Duleep Trophy. He hit his stride by achieving scores of 157 not out, 116, and 19 in the following two rounds, before smashing a remarkable 191 in the Irani Cup match against Mumbai. Easwaran identifies the practice of controlling the controllables as his method for earning the Test cap. \"To play for the country has always been my dream and then to win games for India, I\\'ve always thought about that, and do some visualizing of it as well. But at the end of the day, that is not in my hands. All I can do is try and improve as a cricketer and get better every single day; try and play whatever situations I get. Just try and make my team win whether I play for my state or in the Irani Cup, Duleep Trophy, and India ‘A\\' team. \"So that is what I try and do it by keeping things really simple. The dream is there, but again selection is something which is not in my hands. So I can just control the things which I have in control – that is how hard I work, look forward to the games, and prepare for it. So those are things I look to focus on. It\\'s easier said than done, but I try to do that,\" he adds. Even though Easwaran has yet to be awarded the Test cap, he reminisces about his involvement in the team, with the standout memory being India\\'s exceptional victory over England at Lord\\'s in 2021. Advertisement \"The Shami-Bumrah partnership, which took us into a great position to win a game and then we had 60 overs to get them all out to win at Lord\\'s. It was after a long time that India beat England at Lord\\'s; so it was a very special game. I really enjoyed it, as it\\'s one of the best memories I\\'ve had on cricket.\" Easwaran gained valuable insights from observing the dedicated preparation of senior batters Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara before matches. “The type of preparation every individual does there is really specific. It\\'s about what they want from practice sessions also - they keep it that specific. They have their own game plans and how specifically they practice for that was really great to watch.” The ‘A\\' tours have played a crucial role in India\\'s success in Tests by facilitating a seamless transition of players to the international level. According to Easwaran, the ‘A\\' tours, which will take place again prior to the Test team\\'s departure for Australia, allows players to familiarise themselves with playing in foreign conditions. \"I feel it\\'s a great bridge between domestic cricket and international cricket, because you\\'re playing against a lot of international cricketers, in different conditions, and sometimes in overseas conditions, which gives you a lot of exposure. You\\'re learning a lot about your game and overseas conditions, so it is a great learning process. I\\'ve learned a lot out of these tours.\" Advertisement \"I\\'ve played a lot against many international greats, and have been lucky in that ways to learn a lot from them. Obviously as a captain, when you\\'re leading your country at any level, it is an honour to do that, and I\\'ve really enjoyed doing that by winning a lot of series. I\\'ve been really proud when I\\'ve led my team, and won, as well as learnt a lot from that.\" A game that Easwaran fondly remembers was when he had to step up for India ‘A\\' in the second game against England Lions at Mysuru in 2019, which the hosts won by an innings and 68 runs. \"I hadn\\'t had a good first game, as I got out for 13 (31) in the first game (at Wayanad). I wasn\\'t sure if I was going to play the next game or not. We played on a turning track and we wanted to test ourselves in those conditions. The pitch was a little challenging, and I got a hundred in that game. I had a big partnership with KL Rahul, which I really enjoyed and got to learn a lot during that innings.\" Despite the inte.'}, {'title': 'ASEAN, Japan, China, S Korea leaders meet on economy, N Korea', 'link': 'https://japantoday.com/category/politics/asean-japan-china-s-korea-leaders-meet', 'date': '2024-10-10', 'short_description': \"ASEAN members were joined by Japan's new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and leaders from China and South Korea in Vientiane on Thursday for talks likely to focus on economic cooperation, North Korea's weapons development programs and other regional issues.

The Prime Minister said that he appreciated the willingness of political leaders, civil servants, and the private sector to acknowledge that the country cannot remain at its old level, and that all parties must change. \"People talk about change, but not many understand and try to implement it because if more meaningful and smoother changes are not made, we will return to a gloomy and sluggish state,\" he said in a brief speech during a dinner reception with the Malaysian delegation in Laos on Wednesday (Oct 9) night. The dinner was hosted by Malaysia\\'s Ambassador to Laos, Edi Irwan Mahmud, and his wife, Rashidah Mohd Rashid. Also present at the event were Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan and Investment, Trade, and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz. The Prime Minister said that the political stability currently enjoyed provided the government with the opportunity to improve governance to ensure that the country was managed effectively. \"If you ask me, we have political stability; we should use it to improve governance because no country, regardless of its wealth, can elevate the dignity of its society, nation, and country without trustworthy and responsible management. \"In this regard, the government can introduce clear policies in industrial, digital, energy, and semiconductor sectors, which enable investors to understand and be assured to come (invest) and see for themselves whether we have achieved the expected level of efficiency. \"So far, there have been changes in that direction; however, I always say there is room for improvement,\" he said.

(Photo by Chris Carroll/Corbis via Getty Images) Today 100 CEOs announced a push for governments to boost the business case for green investment, in the run-up to COP29 in Azerbaijan. With a combined revenue of $4 trillion between them, the leaders published a letter urging that “every fraction of a degree counts” when it comes to staying within the 1.5°C global warming target. The alliance represents a lot of power, and a lot of money. Clearly, corporate climate action is becoming mainstream. But the world’s biggest online retailer was conspicuously absent from the letter, so what is it doing on the climate front? Five years ago Jeff Bezos, CEO of the tech behemoth Amazon, launched the Climate Pledge, his plan to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040 — a decade ahead of the Paris Climate Agreement. At the time it seemed like an outlandish pledge that garnered little faith, including from former Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Dame Christiana Figueres — who Bezos approached to work with, and who famously didn’t believe him at first. But when Figueres, the renowned Costa Rican diplomat and one of the key orchestrators of the Paris Agreement herself, came on board, via her own organization Global Optimism (“a group of stubborn climate optimists”) — we all sat up to listen. Despite long standing criticism over its environmental impacts, from the next-day shipping policy to its plastic pollution problem, not only did Amazon sign on to beat the Paris Agreement, it managed to enlist an astonishing amount of companies to join in. Half a decade later and the Climate Pledge is one of the largest corporate climate initiatives out there. From Microsoft to Mercedes-Benz, there are now 525 global companies signed up — representing 55 industries in 40 different geographies. Put simply, the three requirements are: 1. To map, measure and report, 2. To decarbonise, and 3. Where you can’t decarbonise, to offset using nature-based solutions that are credible and permanent. But how did they get so many signatories? According to Kara Hurst, Amazon’s Chief Sustainability Officer, it’s Amazon’s culture of “customer obsession” that has made the pledge so successful. “We are constantly listening and asking, what do you want to have happen, what is valuable to you in this community,” she recently explained on the Outrage and Optimism podcast. WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 19: (L-R) Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Christiana Figueres, the UN's Former ... [+] Climate Change Chief, announce the co-founding of The Climate Pledge at the National Press Club on September 19, 2019 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Amazon) ‘Beating the Paris Agreement’ is a huge statement to make. Both Paris and the 2018 IPCC report warned of the catastrophic climate impacts we would see across the world if we do not limit global warming to 1.5°C, or “well below” 2°C, by the end of the century. Which is why the goal is to achieve net zero globally by 2050. This was considered ambitious — but possible — offering time for governments and businesses to transition away from fossil fuels and allowing for innovation in renewable energy, clean transport, sustainable agriculture and carbon capture technologies. The idea is, if we get there, we will drastically reduce the likelihood of severe climate impacts, from more extreme weather, to melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and ecosystem collapse. We’ve already experienced the world's first year-long breach of 1.5°C. The period from February 2023 to January 2024 reached 1.52C of warming, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service. This doesn't break the landmark Paris agreement, but it brings us closer to doing so in the long-term. So if the 2050 goal is already an audacious one, is it realistic for those signed up to the Climate Pledge to achieve net zero a whole ten years earlier?

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Dame Christiana Figueres is unwavering in her opinion that it is. She tells me, “it is not only realistic for companies to beat the Paris Agreement, it is imperative.” “The power of the Climate Pledge is in the community - we can go faster when we go together,” she continues. “New analysis shows that this group has the potential to help avoid more than 2.5 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions per year when they meet their climate goals.” This is roughly equivalent to a third of the carbon absorbed by the world’s forests each year. Over 500 signatories of the pledge have reduced their scope 1 and 2 emissions by more than 11%, which is double the rate achieved by 3500 companies reporting to the Carbon Disclosure Project. They are doing this by sharing failures and solutions to the problems they encounter on their accelerated timeli.\"}]\n"
